  okay   hi   hi   um   yeah id like to talk about   how you dress   for work and and um   what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear   well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice   so i usually wear skirts and sweaters 
  in the winter time   slacks i guess   and in the summer just dresses   umhum   we cant even well were not even really supposed to wear jeans very often   so   it really doesnt vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of   you know always the same temperature   and is   right right is there is there um 
  an is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask   so   not formally   right   but its kind of understood that   were supposed to dress a little bit nice   a lot of times we have to go over to uh   like jerry junkins office and bill ellsworths office to deliver stuff   right   and we prepare a lot of foils for marvin and bill so 
  we have to dress   a little bit nice   were not   right right   and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like   depending on what you think youll be doing that day   yes now you know if if every like in august when everybodys on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual   or   right   ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but 
  i guess that would have to do with the weather   but um   yes   yeah yeah well i i   thats right   and it   unless its an ex you know an unusual day   yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um i in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but   umhum   um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you 
  yeah   umhum   right   uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you   um   yeah or   umhum   what area do you work in   uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um   and uh and uh 
  anyway um right now i im not   im not there but   but anyway   um   okay   um and seaso really same season to season um   uh it   changes with the weather you know uh   wear light clothing i guess if its hot out but um   it 
  with the   yeah   but then usually in the summer its cold in the offices because the air conditioners doing its job so well   thats   thats true and and i think also that um   the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety m maybe lighter   cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the   oh yeah   the men often   have to wear shirt and tie no matter 
  r right right what time of what time of the year   thats right   it   uhhuh just suits and theres not a whole lot of fabric variance there   and they cant have a rayon suit   so   thats thats true   so um   do they   were were there um 
  are you allowed to   um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those tha   not reall   not really i think i mean its kind of unwritten but i   think were supposed to wear hose and   and shoes you know   most of the people do anyway   right   uh most of the women wear uh   m actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else 
  oh i see uhhuh   but   im not in that professional of a position   so i dont   im not expected to do that   okay and   and   and also like the um also the the   all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar   sim 
  yeah   umhum   yes pretty much im a secretary   yeah   yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like th they were much there was much more casual dress although i dont think everybody looked at that   you know as   a good thing   y yeah but theres really no written rule i guess they couldnt write that down that might be discrimination or something i dont know i mean ive never been told   what to wear or what not to wear   right 
  thats thats right   its just you know judging from what everyone else wears   is how i determine   yeah   yeah and   you know what i feel a comfortable in   you dont wanna stand out too much   thats right   yeah thats true   and um 
  hm   well thats it   well that pretty much covers the subject   well thanks for calling me   yeah   i dont know what el what more we can say about that thats   oh its been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh   okay all right nice talking to you byebye   yep   thats all goodbye 
  okay bye   okay uh first um   i need to know uh   h how do you feel about   uh   about sending   um an elderly   uh   family member to a nursing home   well of course its you know its it 
  one of the last few things in the world youd ever want to do you know unless its just you know   really   you know f and   for their   uh   you know for their own good   yes   yeah   id be very very careful   and uh 
  you know   checking them out   uh   our   had t   place my mother in a   nursing home she had a   rather massive stroke about   uh   umhum 
  uh s   eight months ago i guess   and uh we were i was fortunate in that   i was personally acquainted with the uh people who   uh ran   the nursing home in our little hometown   yes   so i was very comfortable   you know   in doing it when it got to the point that we had 
  to do it   but theres   well   i had an occasion   for my uh   motherinlaw   who   had fell   and needed to be   you know 
  could not take care of herself anymore was   confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience   uh   it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didnt have you know like six months to   check all of these places out   and it was really not   not very good   uh   deal   we were not really happy with the 
  yeah   nursing home that we   finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again   but its really a big uh   big decision as to you know when to do it   yeah   you know is there something else we could have done   you know in   checking out all the places that uh   might be available course theres you know theres not one on every corner 
  especially in   you know smaller areas smaller   towns   umhum   yeah probably the hardest thing   in   in my family   uh my grandmother she had to be put in   nursing home and   um she had used a walker for 
  for quite sometime probably about six to nine months   and um   umhum   she had a fall   and uh finally uh she had   uh parkinsons disease   and it got so much that she could not   take care of her house   sh then she   lived in an apartment 
  and um   hm   right   that was even harder   actually   because it was   you know it was   just a change of   umhum   umhum 
  change of location and   it was very disturbing for her because she had   been so used to traveling   i mean she tr she had she had children all across the united states and   you know she spent   nine months out of the year just visiting her children   yes   umhum   right   uhhuh 
  and um   that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that   you know   no i cannot   i cannot take care of myself   oh i can imagine   umhum   thats tough thats really tough   yeah i mean   for somebody who is 
  you know for most of their life has has   uh   not just merely had a farm but had ten children   had a farm   ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and   you know facing that situation it its quite a dilemma   i think   umhum   umhum   yes 
  my mother excuse me go ahead   yeah   well   my uh   my   uh probably one of the biggest decisions   i think that was very strengthened for our family was   rather than have one child make that decision   umhum   than just 
  delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of   um   all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference   and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family   thats great   getting down   together and doing that   and and just the children were involved in the decision   because it involved just them   and 
  you know making that decision and then   thats right   i   umhum   right   yeah   finding a place and everybody had   duties   to perform you know whether it was just   you know 
  giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like   finding a   a proper nursing home   umhum   umhum   yep   you were very fortunate   and they   i know they and   well they had 
  well they had   they had seen it coming   so   so i mean it   i mean i i i   i hard i   i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me   umhum   umhum   absolutely un unfortunately at a lot of times it 
  responsibilities like that seem to fall to you know   maybe one child in the whole family you know   yeah yeah   well we we   yeah   and uh   its usually not a very smooth   smooth thing   we were uh l   i was lucky too that i only have 
  m one brother   umhum   and uh   fortunately we agreed   you know on   exactly   you know what   we thought should be done   my mother also was   very very independent she had her own still had her own little house and still driving her own car at 
  age eighty three   yeah   we were lucky in that   in one respect in that   after she had her stroke she wasnt really   you know   really   much aware of   what was going on   umhum 
  that nursing home life   would not have been   you know   anything of her choosing of course she would   she would not have been happy there at all   but uh as it turned out the stroke   took care of that   concern for us   yeah   yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was 
  it was such   that uh that she did not have the problem   with   she was very well aware and   her daughter came and visited her   at least her daughter   came and visited her and also her   uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday   umhum   umhum 
  umhum   thats great   and   i think that when she passed away   it was probably   one of the greatest   um   i i i think it would be   it was more of a relief   for her 
  umhum   sure   and   um   i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i di   i dont know how i would   how i would deal if   if one of my parents came with   with   alzheimers or something like that which is 
  which is far more devastating   umhum   umhum   thatd be tough   yes absolutely   and um   i i th i think that what   one   thing that w that they were really concerned with probably   was the fact 
  it wasnt   necessarily   you know like   the   quantity of care   but   the quality of care that the people that work   there   were very   umhum 
  yes   right   umhum   were very interested that to make it as close   a home environment as possible   i i think i think   i think   you know for myself   i i see that as probably the   the 
  umhum   yes   yeah we were fort   what everything would hinge upon   is it how close is it to a home environment   thats the thats probably the major question   oh yes   thats right   umhum   yeah 
  i think a great strides are being made nowadays in in caring for the elderly you know in several in a whole lot of areas se   people are of course   population is getting older   you know   yeah   yeah   yeah   you know its its interesting that   that   a lot of 
  the population in the united states is changing because   you know uh now that so many more minorities   where they have had extended families for such a long time   umhum   um   i matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families   it wasnt   but i guess as we become more industrialized and more   you know less in a rural situation   umhum 
  ts right   yes   we we dont   we we   we choose not to   deal with   the extended family because we feel its kind of cumbersome   when in reality it makes things   much much easier   umhum 
  umhum   thats right   sure   absolutely   and people are families are scattered   so much nowadays   uh   yeah   yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family   you know that that 
  it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e   e even   child care   you   know i mean   of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not   yes   any of the grandparents   would   we 
  feel theyre gonna be a   good   theyre gonna be a good caretaker for our children   but   i mean they raised us after all   yeah yeah   just because theyre grandparents jus   yeah just because theyre grandparents that doesnt automatically make them a good child carer   yeah   but uh 
  im i i think that   you know i mean   we always   uh   i mean ive   ive had a a   lot of good experiences with uh with many many people   especially where theyve had   uh extended family and i   and an i 
  i kind of see that   that   you know perhaps   you know we may need to like   get close to the family environment and   and get down to the values of   you know i mean uh its   umhum   money seems to be   too big of an issue 
  wi with   with   with with with whats going on today and i i think i think that we may not   you know that may be   oh yeah   sure   realistically it is yes   you know   perhaps if we put money on the back burner   that may 
  that may   choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean   i mean we may not   we may not have as   high a standard of living   but   umhum   that would certainly help yeah   umhum   the 
  qua but actually   have a truer standard of living   right thats just a matter of defining priorities i guess   or some priorities anyway   yeah yeah   yeah   i think your right   okay   well   i guess that was it 
  okay   was good talking to you   yeah   take care   byebye   okay   all right   hey   byebye   alrighty 
  uh i guess our topic today is air pollution   and   we are to just discuss   what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution   as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us   right   um   does your work entitle   uh   anything in environmental along these lines 
  me im in the legal department and um   we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues   umhum   and   i dont know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that ti has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know were coming up with a   a new solution we have   been   finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but   after while it always seems that the um   oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such 
  but   the new   idea is to take everything up to sherman   and were gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly   that facility   will not generate   air pollutants   very   from what ive heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator   and just burn it all up and that we wont be polluting the air im sure we have to have 
  uh permits you know for that place and that theres you know limits as to what we can   uh let   you know go into the air   yeah its uh   having   uh   uh   w   well i work in too i work in environmentals uh   projects right now 
  and so the sherman deal is uh uh   uh   oh okay   lost a lot of hair over that project   uh   what we run into   um   is we have the texas air control board tacb that send out   uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh   uh reply to 
  oh   uhhuh   and a lot of their   rules and regulations arent real clear so we have our manager of environmental who   assist   the tacb which is located in austin   in writing and hey look what weve done here at ti   umhum   and uh   we are presently uh in receipt of a 
  site permit which will allow us to   um   uh this is air side   a   allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage its in in in tons per year   um   uhhuh   okay   and   so 
  w w you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh hightech scrubber systems   uh that uh scrub out the nox and uh vocs and   and the ammonia compounds uh   li all the acids   uh to a certain level   we are very um   uh aware of   the opacity which is the   thickness of a stack   emissions so if you dont see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero 
  or twenty or there abouts   umhum   and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking theres a problem   and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely   uh   it   becomes a real issue especially when its smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto   hm   as you know the theyre allowed to come on site the   federaldes 
  anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so its a full time   uh everybody has your home phone number type of job   uh   hm   now is that place built or youre still in the makings of it   the sherman facility we are still in the   closer to but still have a little bit of um   finalization to do right its been pitched to the sherman uh   city council with   uh open arms as well as the public 
  we had open forum and and uh   hm   uh tom jones our environmental corporate environmental guys handling the project   umhum   and uh its real   uh going real well i think its matter   just a matter of fund the funds right now   as i understand it   umhum   uh but its uh 
  its something else yeah tha theyre in the same   issue we were uh   hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there   uh   because the the system is setup where it wont have any emissions uh youre correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature   but it wont have uh   any uh   right   any bad stuff   so uh i think ti we spend o o of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put 
  safety and environmental on the   utmost foremost   uh   uh   first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of   we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here   and uh   its an interesting job   but um   well i know from some of the sites that weve had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and 
  you know the law now is a super fund and anybody whos contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know   uh damaged the ground or not   uh everybody has to contribute and its been a lot of big bucks when weve uh   gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up thats you know mega bucks to uh   you know   take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and   um   certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the sherman facility than   um   just letting it go in the ground because eventually you know i it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined 
  uh dump area   it still only   in time starts to leak out   possibly   yeah   there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again   hm   jeez   uh im   familiar with that one 
  we uh   we have stuff thats very interesting yeah   we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh   interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh   that we sample   and it may have uh over uh   a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it   umhum   and uh we cant deep well inject something like that   because its a solid and we mix it with concrete 
  and actually   um   potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground   umhum   but not so   not   in a hazardous waste   location because its basically a concrete slab   hm   which is totally 
  legal   but the cost of doing this is astronomical   they actually shave up ductwork and things and so were uh   very very uh   cognizitive and aware of all these type of   uh   umhum   expenditures because it can get very expensive but i think we you know we   do all kinds of things to make the   the the world a better place to live 
  and i think some of the folks that arent aware of it will be surprised at how much   effort and energy is put into doing that i really would   um   ive enjoyed speaking with you   yeah   this has been an interesting topic uh   i was one of the   i was responsible for all the planning and engineering of the corporate area in the north building   yeah   oh you were 
  oh okay   so uh   i hope you like your office   yes   yes its a heck of a lot different i mean w we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk we were about the only place in you know ti that had the gray metal desk people used to come and laugh and go gee i hadnt seen one of those in ten fifteen years   yeah   yeah   glad to see yall taken care of well   the i think what changed everything and uh   is uh yall w 
  yall the only ones that make any money for ti here in the last two years   we finally got a little respect nobody thought of us as a profit center before   s   exactly and thats um when you start m when you start paying your wages you know jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys   right right   not just overhead   ive enjoy   exactly ive enjoyed speaking with you   see you later byebye   you too 
  bye   well   what do you think are some of the main causes of air pollution   well i guess without a doubt wed have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes uh   quite a bit to air pollution   yeah   i i   i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then theres   like you say theres industry   with all the uh sulfur and 
  all that other stuff theyre dumping out into the atmosphere   causing acid rain and everything else   uh y yeah you know im wondering   uh   course uh freon is uh is uh   eating away at our   hm   uh what you call that layer there   ozone layer   ozone yeah 
  ozo   ozone pollution yeah   i wonder when theyre gonna what theyll be able to use in pro in place of freon   well i was   i was thinking about that too i mean uh we dont have any suitable replacement for freon and y and   you have to have it for refrigeration so   but on the other hand you know i ive   um   i took a boat cruise one time   and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane 
  i it was actually powered by a   flame   uh well   actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works   yeah   uh it it   something with heat i dont understand the mechanics of it but uh   well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat   umhum   be it electrical as in your home refrigerator 
  or propane as the one on the ship that you said   umhum   uh you had   and uh somehow cr heat must be created   that freon   oh im not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and   in the   process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes fr c   uh ice cold   oh okay so it still had freon in it 
  oh yes yes   freons uh freon is in a closed circuit   oh okay   i well li   yeah   yeah   uh thats why   our present day refrigerants uh   systems are not   dangerous unless 
  the lines are broken   right   which happens all the time when they go to service the things   w well   did you ever see what happens when they uh   replace the or replenish the freon in your automobile air conditioner   umhum   i mean theres uh   a lot of it   is uh turned out into the atmosphere 
  yeah escape   sure   yeah   yeah i   and i understand now   uh i dont know if its   international or just here in texas or what   but   uh   service stations are going to require 
  to have a special device   to   catch this freon as it is ex expelled   the excess freon   and therefore you wont be able to just pull in anywhere to or   you wouldnt even be able to do it yourself at home   hm well that makes sense   i im more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i   i think were getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and   all that kind of stuff 
  uh   cooperating with the canadians on the acid rain problem   but the ozone   i mean you know we cant replace that   no thats true   we   we cant clean it up   you know i can remember as a child uh   spending summers at my grandfathers place and id be running around with nothing but a   bathing suit 
  no shoes socks shirts or anything   umhum   uh i mean from dawn till dusk   umhum   and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it   never had to worry about   uh skin cancer   burning and everything else   or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and and get a drink of water without worrying a   yeah 
  about catching some disease   yeah   yeah thats right when i was a kid i used to do the same thing   its uh   i   i dont kn i dont know what the rain forests have to do with it but you know theyre chopping those down at a   tremendous rate everyday   and i just have a feeling that that you know thats our s thats our   air scrubbing   stuff there and theyre 
  theyre taking away the sponge   hm yeah   yeah   i dont know this uh   ozone   i tell you   funny thing happened to me with with polluted water   uh ti sent   me up on a trip to   wyoming i think it was 
  and i was out in this little   town kind of backwoods town you know uh   where big night on the town is going down watching the   traffic light change   yes   but uh i checked into a motel   and after i signed in and everything   why the uh clerk told me uh   dont drink the water   its contaminated 
  he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately were out of it right now but as   as soon as we get it   i ill see that you get a bottle of it   well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it   i brushed my teeth with cocacola   naw i can believe it   y you pr you probably did less harm than what the water would have done though   oh well th they had this uh   its uh   some kind of a bacteria call or carried by animals 
  umhum   and it   they got their water from this uh   beautiful mountain   river   umhum   well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream   umhum   but this uh bacteria had   uh 
  penetrated their entire   pipe system   or water system   gosh   and they tried flushing it out they they couldnt get rid of it   go   well its   ive often wondered now this is years ago and ive often wondered what they ever did   course the oh was a   beautiful mountain stream 
  bubbling nicely you know the which uh   is what purifies water when it bubbles   yeah   right   the   the action over the rocks and all that kind   of stuff   yes   and yet even at that it was still contaminated   jeez 
  well thats scary   i it it worries me to turn on the   turn on the taps now because you never know whats gonna come out   yeah   yes   you kn   and i and i don i dont really trust these these government agencies that test this stuff   i really dont   well im beginning to wonder too i mean you g youre always hearing stories about well the government okayed this   then all of a sudden you turn around and 
  my gosh its okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way its   dangerous   yeah well its   its like so many o its like chicken   you know they go in there and they supposedly inspect this chicken   i dont know if you ever saw that 60 minutes thing where they   showed a chicken processing plant   as a matter of fact i did   yeah i i havent touched chicken since   neither have i 
  yeah i i couldnt i couldnt bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that   and but the government says its safe uhhuh   uh yeah   right   thats about what they say about the   the air pollution in this country   and they s s   eah its getting better its getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like los angeles is s still so thick you have to cut it with a knife   i dont know   ive often wondered about the la now thats supposed to be about the worst c city in the country i guess for 
  just about yeah   air pollution   yeah   um   i dont know you know used to be a lot of states had uh   uh you had to have your car checked for pollution   every year   you had to have that little sticker in the window i know texas does   uh yeah   umhum 
  and   there are about three places in georgia that does   and i think louisiana does im not sure but i theres not very many of them around anymore   well   uh they used to do it down in florida now i lived down there for ten years   yeah they dont do it anymore   no they did away with it because they found out that uh   yeah   the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them   umhum 
  i think thats the problem with most of it the politicians finally did away with it because the people were so mad about having to pay that fee   a   and for n uh for nothing   too   yeah a and i mean all it was was a revenue generator   yeah   i it wasnt serving the purpose that it was designed to serve   i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching   huge   blue 
  clouds of   oil smoke   and you tell me that guy passed a pollution test   you know   umhum   well now heres another thing diesels   uh diesel engines are uh   the worst   oh yeah   oh those are 
  and yet they havent done a thing to them   yeah   i mea you know what was it back in the uh   late seventies when diesel engines were the thing   because it was uh so much cheaper than gas now you look   diesels   what one forty one fifty a gallon while gas is   o you know one oh five   uhhuh   yeah t t tell me about it i just got rid of a 
  a diesel engine escort   i never did like diesels anyway they they were   too cantankerous   cold w   well i um   i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago   um   yeah i had a friend of mine had a uh had a buick   had   had a diesel in it and he had nothing but trouble with the thing 
  is that right   well   yeah winter time the the   diesel would gel and it wouldnt   i dont know liquefy right and then his   injector things got clogged and oh go   uhhuh   well now there was at one time   as a matter of fact it may have been buick i think because i think it was gm that came out with a   disea uh 
  diesel   engine that was converted from   a gas engine   umhum   and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the uh   uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over   and although they were   it seemed practical at the time   they were   nothing but a headache 
  yeah   and they did aw w t we finally did away with them and went to a straight diesel   that that may that   yeah that may have been what he had   um   but speaking of cars   what more can we do to cars to make them   less polluting   well now course in california theyre   they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere 
  yeah   now could be that we could do the same thing that theyre doing out in california   i dont know what it is precisely but uh theyre doing they do something   a little more stricter than we do   im just wondering about the feasibility of electric cars   i saw an article in the pap   hi cynthia   what did you wear to work today   um lets see what did i wear to work today um   actually i wore 
  corduroy shorts   with a white blouse um   and flat shoes   so can you dress pretty casually   um on occasion on occasion um i do vary   um you know i wear suits i wear skirts and sweaters   on occasion i can wear jeans um   how about you   yeah   well i um 
  run a business out of my home   umhum   so i tend to   get up in the morning   put on sweats   um   do   whatever i wanna do with the kids then whenever i have a   meeting with a client ill put a suit on   and then 
  and   uhhuh   uhhuh   come home and get back into regular clothes again   uhhuh   um   you know theres real no no no real dress code where i work um you see people   wearing   you know all different attire   i um dont like to wear heels that really tires me out i work in a big building 
  yeah   so i i predominantly wear flat shoes um you know in the winter i wear sweaters in the summer i you know   i like one piece dresses short sleeves   things like that   ive   recently um   t   tried to update my wardrobe trying to put   suits together that i can interchange the jackets and the blouses and all that a lot   right 
  right   thats helped me a lot with   having   i can only have a   a limited   wardrobe since im only working parttime right now   um but still it gives it some variety   add different blouses and scarves and   belts and things like that   uhhuh 
  umhum   umhum   right   right accessories uhhuh   what about your casual wear   do you   like to wear jeans most of the time   um   yeah mostly i mean at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that also   yeah 
  its nice you can wear shorts especially on a day like today when its so hot   yeah well theyre um   you know theyre like ber   yeah theyre like   black corduroy ber bermuda shorts   and sometimes i wear a blazer with them and i get   really a lot of compliments on them   um where i work is predominantly male   so   you know 
  dress shorts   yeah   yeah   they their attire is always the same you know suits or slacks you know jeans whatever and um   but im really the only woman i guess at work that does that but   seems to work for me   in fact i just bought or i just got a new outfit as a gift   that   um   not much 
  yep   its one of those skorts you know the the its shorts but it looks like a skirt   so i think thatll be good for work too   umhum   oh yeah itll be comfortable   yeah   yeah   so   i guess down here uh   we just recently moved to 
  texas so   my wardrobe has changed quite a bit   um we moved from colorado where   and i have a closet full of sweaters   that   uhhuh   uhhum   uhhuh well see i live in virginia   you   live in virginia 
  now   oh thats interesting   uhhuh   yeah   yeah so im you know   like right now   today was in about you know the fifties   but um   you know i i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses   uhhuh 
  yeah   id like to be able to wear those here today its eighty eight degrees   so   needless to say my sweaters have been   hung in the closet for   quite a while now   oh my   uhhuh   uhhuh   today was uh 
  definitely a shorts day around here   umhum   yeah were still pretty much you know in winter   as far as that goes here   this is pretty uns unseasonal but   um   at   least we   you know   it it 
  it feels good it   gets uh   everybody   doesnt have cabin fever today its nice to get out and about   umhum   uhhuh   i guess weve discussed everything there is about clothing   okay   okay it was nice talking to you also   byebye 
  okay   sounds good   was nice talking to you   byebye   have you done   a lot of camping recently   no i havent been camping since i was about sixteen   oh okay   but uh my family used to have a   popup trailer 
  and wed go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in bastrop texas once   oh yeah   uh wheres that   its near austin   oh okay   im not that much familiar with texas weve been my family   has been everywhere   but mostly   in texas on the way to someplace else   weve had 
  oh   gosh weve   umhum   ive camped in a   in a in a   back of a v   van then we g then we got a popup camper and then we got a trailer now theyve got   now theyve got a big motor home so they they still do a whole lot of camping   have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks   oh gosh yes uh 
  oh yellowstone   about four years ago four or five years ago and um   oh we di   my family when i was younger we went   that was just you know what we did in the summers was go to the   from you know national park to national park   we had a lot of fun   when i go camping i dont i dont like to rough it i like to   have s a little bit of el electricity and a little bit of running water   yes 
  me too   im not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing   oh no   no   ive done it but its not fun   you dont want to do it for like three weeks at a time thats for sure   god   i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer theyre both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to new mexico   and they just   find places to camp and go looking for rocks and 
  ooh no   no   doesnt sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went   uh she just got   tired of the tent and it was cold at night and   she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night   oh yeah   just for fun   shaking the scorpions out of their shoes   no kidding no kidding 
  gosh thats what the   the   the bugs i dont like the bugs   oh me neither me neither th   the squitoes just   keep you up all night   yeah the one g   nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock   and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours   yeah 
  yeah th thats nice   yeah   when my fa when my   family camps were the   the only time youre at the camper is when you want to sleep   otherwise youre just going constantly you know   in all the in all the national parks and stuff   oh   hum   we camped at the lets see we camped down at at galveston 
  two or three years ago and that   that was that was fun except that they uh were   having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were   and the and the smell of that was kind of   gross but   we stayed in galveston island state park once   but if a storm blew in and it was   just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp   the little camping area was pretty near the shore   oh how awful 
  umhum   oh yeah   and there were some   pretty big dunes   before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and   couldnt even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because youd get sand in your eyes   oh thats miserable   yeah it was pretty bad   yeah i ha   yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usua 
  we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and   they my parents always let us take a couple of friends   so we always had a good time   yeah   yeah its i y its y you always when you when theres kids youve always got to have other stuff to do because its always gonna rain sometime   and then your par   par they drive the parents nuts   yeah   yeah and   yeah well children arent easily entertained by just enjoying the nature 
  oh i know i wish id app i wish id appreciated it more   y   uh when i was when we were camping so extensively y   when w when we were younger   yeah   now i   wish i could go back to those places   yeah the time and ive got   got a   child and another one on the way so 
  i wish i had time my m our popup camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately   oh gosh it makes it a little   my fiance and i one day would like to   own a big motor home   mainly because hes a football hes a college football coach and were gonna have to travel a lot   uhhuh   yeah   and itd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without   spending big money for a hotel and and   park it outside of the stadium and 
  have a good ole time   yeah   thats true   plus its nice to have your own stuff there   yeah   plus you get   eating out is ex is so expensive   and   umhum   that is nice 
  no kidding it really is   so it it it its a   it can be really handy to have a camper   just   um   because my our family lives in missouri   and uh when we   take trips home we take our popup with us in good weather and   stay overnight at a   state park or something so we dont have to rent a hotel room and 
  thats   oh yeah   thats nice   you know paying five or six dollars instead of   forty   yeah   no kidding   yeah well   what else   well 
  i think thats just pretty much it weve been on here awhile   okay   well its been nice talking to you   nice talking to you too   bye   byebye   this is archie   hi archie im sharon   have you seen dancing with wolf   yeah ive seen that thats uh that was a really good movie 
  probably one of the best things about it was the scenery   and uh   i thought the story was pretty good too i th i think kevin costner did a really good job with it   have you ever lived in that part of the country   no i havent   have you ever visited it   um ive visited the wyoming area im not sure exactly where   dances with wolves was filmed   i think it was the black hills of south dakota   could be i i havent been to south dakota 
  ha have you been up to that   well i lived in omaha for   five winters   and that rolling kind of   uh   oh   okay   terrain   yeah is is fairly fami   the thing that i thought was interesting 
  was that the critics apparently its gonna win everything   really   uh   and i had been told you know you wouldnt notice that it was three hours long and all this kind of   thats true i agree with that um   i i noticed yesterday in the paper something said that   it   i think its been nominated for twelve awards and and all the critics initially said that you know it wouldnt go anywhere that it was just going to   be a dud   so it it has surprised everybody 
  well the interesting thing was is i had heard that and i i   i tend to i think overreact occasionally when somebody tells me its that great and and   it was   the thing is it was a it was a good story   uhhuh   right   and   and   and i guess thats what i really like although i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour   yeah 
  did you   have you seen sleeping with the enemy   no   ive heard   ive heard thats really great though   y you have to go see that one and how about silence of the lambs   go   no   you must really keep up   i do i go every weekend 
  i i uh those are two   definite must   see movies i think   we isnt isnt sleeping with the enemy isnt that a   i   is it   is it a terror movie   or is it just suspenseful   its suspenseful i dont think its very t i mean theres not really any   uh blood and guts in it or anything like that 
  its its more suspense   um   the other one silence of the lambs is kind of   a a gory movie if if somebodys not into that kind of stuff its its pretty graphic at points   but uh i think theyre both excellent movies   do you do you listen to gary cohill   cohi   is uh   you know who he is   no huhuh 
  yeah somebody in south carolina told me about him   hes a the movie critic um   oh youve   oh okay hes a movie critic n channel eight in dallas   yeah   and he does uh he has a talk show on the   klif   anyway its on from seven to nine or something and and and people call in and its if you keep up with movies its kind of interesting theres a certain amount of drivel that they do theyve got uh theyve got a couple of kids   ten or twelve years old and they call in and they review movies but its uh   oh 
  he anyway he its interesting you listen to him and then you   you go watch the movie fact they had   people had just seen i was listening sunday night a little bit when i was uh   going to   uhhuh   pick up my daughter but anyway it was uh   i the it its interesting though the the   the difficulty with   with   dancing with wolves is that when you make a movie like that and you produce it 
  and then you star in it   uh   the question is did he did he really know it was gonna   be good or did he just do it   i think that i think he really his heart was in it but i d   i dont think he really knew it was gonna be as big as it was i think it was something that he really wanted to do   he wanted to direct it he wanted to a to star in it   you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really w   he really wanted it whether it   whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because 
  i think that   i think he did a good job and and   the selfsatisfaction he got out of it is much   greater than any awards   that they can give him   do you know who the guy was that was playing the uh the the wagon driver   um   a little piece of trivia   you know the guy when he first headed out from the army post   yeah who no i dont know who that guy is 
  he   he plays on murphy brown   oh he does   yes   hes   as a recurring character every week   hes eldon   her housepainter   oh   no now see id a id a never put those two together 
  do you believe that   thats   thats one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said did you notice that i thought no its really   funny but i thought   it it turns you think back and yeah it was him but with a   huhuh   yeah   you know with the beard and all that stuff i mean its uh   yeah real scruffy looking   yeah real scruffy looking and it wa it was really funny its uh 
  that that he winds up   playing in the movie but i thought   its good that   you know   it was a lot of fun   yeah   i dont know how long this conversation is supposed to go but were at about five minutes i should think weve done enough   you think so i mean i havent been watching my watch   um   well i dont know wh how do we end this thing i think it just says hang up 
  why dont we do that   goodbye sharon   well the first thing for me is i wonder   i see a couple of different ways of talking about what   privacy is   um   if privacy is something that   disturbs   your private state   i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state 
  thats   one thing   and if privacy is something   that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you thats another   and the first kind of   invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me   in very much everyday in this country but in   the second type   at least   overtly uh where someone comes in and uh 
  finds out information about you that should be private uh   does not seem uh   um   obviously everyday   i   i think i agree with that   i think in a good example on the   typical thing that happens   uh when the phone rang and   its ti calling 
  my immediate reaction is th ts some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited   thats right   so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that   i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was   almost an example of a si   an invasion that turns out to be not invasive   uhhuh   right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation   exactly   uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of 
  uh   probably seven   or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes   that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it   from from personal parties or from these   uh phone answer phone   uh   commercial things   commercial   soli solicitations primarily 
  oh that thats a remarkable number i get them rarely and im still astounded that   that uh   one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever   um   because im usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are   yeah   i think they prey on peoples um   inherent politeness on the phone   even with a   machine 
  i   find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say   and then they feel an obligation to respond even though theres   not even a person there   and i think thats what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you   ones feeling obligated   because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out   umhum   umhum umhum   and and uh that 
  that then ends up being the   the most   common example for me   umhum umhum   um   i guess im not   typically feeling   invaded in my privacy relative to this second   yeah   thi one that you raised and i dont think i would have thought about that i think thats a good idea on your part 
  i dont typically feel intruded on on the things oh   in the sense of finding out information   well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean   you know the classic   oh i dont know cia conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge   so theres   things that invade   that second type of privacy   where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and   i cant talk about the second one other than to to 
  to generate paranoia   yeah to surmise and   id like to think thats its quite low at least in this country   i dont feel like the kgb is monitoring my phone or anything like that   to s   to surmise   it is there   well i guess although   i   well thats a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because 
  uh if thats the case of a tree falling in the forest and im not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasnt been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded   umhum   yeah   umhum umhum   umhum   um   if your defining it in terms of information gone   even if its something you dont know about it well then i guess one could assume one   was invaded but i dont feel invaded by it   umhum 
  umhum   i dont have a sense of   threat in general from those sorts of things im not sure why uh i guess   it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true   i   i dont have a sense of loss from that   umhum well you must have a relatively clean conscience then   uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s theres someone found out something or surmised something that werent true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense   yes yes youd b more harmed or something   yeah 
  bec right because you dont have anyway to turn it off the did you hear about this lotus   database that was being put together   yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it   that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because   i would find   that thered be   cou good possibility that their facts were   were fantasy   umhum umhum   and then i would feel 
  not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me   that i would rather they didnt and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that   that i   would have thought to be private   but then if it turns out to generate   umhum   umhum   incorrect things thats even worse uh   or if my call rate of of eight t   or so a week went up 
  even higher because   uh someone had   had   umhum   umhum   they had you pegged   right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money   and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly   yeah   yeah 
  yeah   and i one of the problems with the lotus database was   uh   that it was   uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but   uh   you know just like   software is only given out to customers i mean you cant believe that   it would it would be pirated and they wouldnt bother to check that carefully anyway to someone whos offering   right 
  right   you know   full cash price   for it i mean   you know you cant tell what   what a company really has to do with it and theres something   rather ominous about having   right   virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and   and that hacker just has to get into 
  in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then   what   started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home   umhum   and i guess that   turns out to be the   basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not youre feeling threatened as a result of   of it so   s maybe that is a a little bit of what   privacy is 
  yeah   yes exactly   umhum   i also hm thought about it because i was uh waiting to talk to you that   another thing   that occurred to me is   theres not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isnt   but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from   social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someones gonna invade my privacy very quickly   and 
  umhum   i realize that that   i mean   i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in india   and   things are quite   different there in terms of that theres less of a sense of privacy in fact its said that no indian language has a word for privacy   certainly a language i know doesnt but just has a word for loneliness   loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different   oh thats interesting 
  but   but no concept for wanting to be private   yeah its its generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially   okay   um   so theres not i mean   doors dont have latches on them people dont tend to knock you just if theres a door closed you open it because its in your way you people walk in and out and   as a as a westerner in india i was often surprised and felt my   sense of privacy there was quite invaded   oh 
  th that would be   thatd be culturally shocking   you know it it very much is   but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic   uhhuh   and people would leave me alone   uhhuh   whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you   violate the uh the norms   of socia of um public behavior 
  um   people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although   if you know what the social norms are   you know   quote unquote you asked for it   but it does mean that you   have   yet another reason to follow a set of social norms   yes   and which 
  isnt al always the case in all cultures and it wasnt until   i was thinking about it just now th i realized thats actually something thats culturally relative   that   that is true i hadnt thought about that and and that is fascinating to   to think about someone who doesnt know how to say private   umhum umhum   and theyve really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things like that i mean they o   you go to india and its obvious you know the results of sex are quite obvious as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years   um but i i just dont quite   um 
  theres hope   i actually for all for the time ive spent there i still dont quite understand how certain things that   i assume and   require privacy and require not just that   you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy   yes   because anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that   theres this invisible barrier around me which people will re will respect   and if thats gone um i i r really dont know how to live very well   and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that 
  yes   thats interesting   are th are there any other specific things that   that you feel like   where where you   feel your privacy to be invaded on a daytoday basis or   either g on a growing   frequency   well the class the other classic examples the jehovahs witness or or mormons or someone knocking at the front door   um 
  which   is more intrusive because i have to f   really   tell someone to go away   and theres that sense of i have now opened my door they now see   what i look like what i live like and   norm and theyre doing something that normally i really only invite people to   because i   okay   any f anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me 
  but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion   so thats another example of the invasion because of a nonsol   arch how are you doing tonight   good and yourself   oh that yeah fine   kind of tired   yeah me too   where am i calling   pardon me   where are you 
  im in lewisville   lewisville okay im in garland   um   have you read anything about how they   propose to uh come up with the taxes   to increase the funding for schools   little bit   what do you think about it   equalization of funding   thats a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you dont want 
  to have to take away but on the other hand you dont want uh   the poorer school districts to go under either and   uh   here in lewisville they had a   thing on the ballot that they wanted to   uh   rollback the taxes   on everybodys houses and everybody would save   uhhuh   uh 
  twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and   i happened to know a   good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would   just take away all all their money   umhum   and as far as im concerned you know hey   twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and   they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools thats what we need because we got   you know   texas is known for its poor schools and thats too bad because we got little kids and were 
  uh not too pleased about that   but were not funding them like other states either though you know it   were not funding our schools like other states either   pardon me   thats true   thats right   but just because weve got a lot of money doesnt mean thats gonna solve the problem   yeah   i know thats thats only part of the problem   i mean i think theres a lot of waste in 
  in schools   im a teacher i feel that yes i f i definitely feel that way   all this money thats being paid for administrators   i think were gonna s   are you   okay   i think were gonna see a day come   yeah   humum   i can 
  i think i think were gonna see a day when   s uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition   just like colleges are   uh   and itll only be to those who are having kids going to school thats probably the most fair way but   you know uh that way   old people dont have to have have   money going to the schools because they dont have little kids going to schools   but uh   i wouldnt be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening 
  and   uh   well see what happens   well   theyre already talking about freedom of choice   you know for schools   thats an idea   yeah   yes   um 
  i dont know   that   i think has   pluses and minuses   because uh those that   are economically disadvantaged wont have the ability to make a choice   the choice will be thrust upon them   and so wheres the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and   thats   thats true 
  but like in garland   you can choose the school that youre going to   can you tell this is past bedtime   um   like in garland they get to choose the schools that theyre gonna go to   but they got to have the transportation to them if its out of their district you know out of their area i mean   yes   so and i like that   because you can find out the good schools in your area   yes 
  i think the only way theyre gonna really   get to the problem   and solve it is to have   equal funding for every school in the state   whether you its in a poor tax district or a high tax district and   uh   thats the only way that i can see its gonna be resolved is there are gonna be   people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and   and   its gonna be a real bad mess because theres 
  people on every side of the problem   so just distribute it equally   and not raise taxes   yeah   and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise   tha   thats the problem is the teachers dont get enough money   and   anybody who could be a good teacher   doesnt want to become a teacher 
  usually because they dont pay enough   i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching   uh   for my degree   and   uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but   i really   couldnt go into teaching because it was not economically   feasible for me to do so   yeah 
  what do you do   im a mathematician   oh so you picked a good field then   you picked a good field   pardon me   oh i dont know   there are better fields to pick   well   yeah   but thats not a bad one 
  i mean   yeah where i you know   kind of stuff i do i i use my   education quite a bit but where i was before i wasnt using it hardly at all   so it all depends i mean   it   depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it   you know i   but wouldnt mind getting back into it someday but   who knows whatll happen in the future 
  the way   people are being laid off right and left its all a matter of uh   what happens next   but uh   ba back to the taxes though i mean   uh its a   difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something   yeah   what do you think about a state income tax   i can see that there might be 
  a reason for one but i would hate to do that because   uh   that would be very difficult for my family financially to   to afford a state income tax   and   most states have it i know and ive lived in states that have had it   but   way uh way financing is now   if we had a state income tax id   uh 
  have a very hard time financing my house again   you know paying off my mortgage each month thats so thats a problem   um   which just matter of well see what happens   id rather have that i guess than have a s   state lottery   because when you bring   but didnt they pass that thing   that we were gonna have a lottery or not   no it didnt 
  oh   which means theres a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though   good old tax and spend annie my favorite   uh   decided that   uh during the campaign she said we werent gonna have a state income tax and now shes gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway   uh well see what happens i dont know   at any rate uh   so what about your income tax   that 
  think theyre hitting you too hard   actually no   um   no   im surprised that m uh my income taxes are as low as they are   uh we just finished our income taxes and were getting a nice little refund back this year which is   which is nicer than having to pay out   uh which is a matter of uh   um   im surprised its 
  well considering the national budget   i think george bush wanted   one point four trillion dollars   for the national budget   and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to   over twenty two thousand dollars that we   it its our share to pay in   but im not paying that much income tax   huhuh   and youre gonna think well wait now 
  wheres the other   eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in   wh how how is that coming from me   i guess it comes from companies and   businesses and whatnot but   its interesting i dont know   i cant imagine i guess thats why were going in debt so deeply   they bring in   half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to   to the national debt 
  which just keeps accumulating   i dont know   what else do you think about them lets see the state   thats about it i guess   and the city tax the sale tax   they used to you really didnt even think anything about it when you bought something   but now you do   it figures in what is it seven point   yeah   yeah 
  seven percent or something   it depends on where youre at   some places in dallas i guess its like   closer to eight and   places like in lewisville its a lot closer to seven   i dont even know how they figure it really   im glad i dont work in a store   humum   hows that   because i wouldnt want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess theyve got a little table though and its all written out 
  oh yes   so it wouldnt be so bad   all right so you think   thats the way to do it   federal tax is okay   state tax   you can see the logic of it but   you dont think it would be   economically feasible for your family   and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too 
  no   yeah   we dont need anymore   and so when you start taking talking   taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax   uh   but we can do this tax sheltered annuity   thats the only thing thats saving us   yeah   i think what we n what 
  uh   the government   the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending   because when they got all this fraud and waste going on   they need to just get in there and   and   get out the garbage thats in there right now   i mean   i once heard that uh   uh for the for the federal government at least that 
  if they uh   uh well   for like on the welfare system   if they gave   all that money   directly to the people   every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year   and you know theyre not making that much money theyre making probably more like five or six   on the welfare so wheres the other ninety percent going well its going to the   some 
  fat guy in the middle whos sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but   filling out papers   par   lots and lots of people   before they get it   lots of people yeah   yeah   but still i work in southeast dallas   and a lot of my children are   from 
  poor   you know socioeconomic areas   homes and its just   like   they always have money   they they always are dressed nice you know   most of them are   fairly nice   not like   you would think a a poor person would 
  be   yeah   and i mean theyve always got dessert money or theyve always got   you know dollars on them and everything and im thinking   you know this isnt right   because my children dont have that   yeah   well i dont have that   a lot of times if ive got a dollar in my wallet its like boy where do i g where did whered i find that   yeah and you give them you know they get their free lunch 
  and they throw most of it away   but then they have their money to go buy dessert and that they eat   wow   you know its just you see   garbage pans   i mean pails just   filled and we pay people to haul them off   right   yeah   right 
  and the like a guy does it and he has his own pigs   quite a quite a world we live in   that he   yeah   it is   oh well is that you got anything else to say   i dont think i do   oh well   yeah thats all i have to say   thank you 
  okay   well   ta   talk to you later then   bye   umhum bye   uh how do you feel about gun control   uh on the scale they gave one to ten id say im probably a four   im not   totally 
  im not   one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i dont think we should be carrying uzis either   you know what i mean   yeah i know i mean i dont think machine guns automatic weapons i dont believe in things like that but i think   some people do i know   that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so   choose   a but i think there should be some   restrictions when you buy one   you know they should do more background search on you they should 
  i think it should be harder to buy one   right   yeah theres a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun   because they dont really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores   yeah   no they dont they dont ask anything except how old you are i dont think   thats kind of scary   im from california   my mo the last time i was like purchased a gun my   my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one 
  and   uhhuh   they he had to fill out some forms but i guess california might be tougher   i dont know   yeah they might be   or you know how we are here in texas its like everybodys a hunter so   im not much of a hunter but   yeah   its   ive never even bought a gun myself 
  my   dads given it to me or   someones given me one so im probably real illegal   you know carrying guns that arent even mine   yeah its a its a hard decision to make   it really is uh   the only problem i have with   gun control is that they   the radicals wanna   ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be 
  be the people who are gonna kill you anyway   like the bumper sticker   its true   yeah   yeah exactly   right it really is because theyre gonna get them one way or another   they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so   right   right   right 
  and theyre illegal   so i dont think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together   no   i yeah i i i i i agree that it would be like   people in   people that are   uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do   come into your house or something   right   thats true 
  i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one   when they buy them   yeah i have   have gun g have have gun management 101   right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until youve taken this course sign up here   something like that   yeah or req re   required for every college student   oh   right exactly 
  before graduation   god   gun control   its its such a heated topic in the   the and people get so emotional about it   yep   oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it   all the ive worked with a lot of people that hunt   and they just   they 
  they dont see any sense in it at all   they think its ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course theyre hunters they know what theyre doing they dont realize therere a bunch of crazy people out there that   some of them are crazy too   whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting   dont use it for that   well yeah thats true   they shoot each other thinking theyre a deer   yeah darn i thought you were a deer bob sorry my mistake   yeah marge i dont know what happened to your husband   he just never came back 
  looked like antlers i dont know   yep   that happens a lot too   yeah   oh   but   i guess thats it   thats my opinion on it   so what now   im not sure 
  uh   uh   i think we just hang up   yeah   okay   thanks   bye   i   lets see   y yeah we just say goodbye and hang up 
  okay okay   okay thanks byebye   have you ever got one of those calls thats either generated by a computer or somebody going   down a list and theyre either   offering a service   or   theyre   introducing some new product in the area and   normally when they call youre either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone   yes yes 
  that is that one that you were talking about   that was the   big one im talking about i work   weird hours   and invariably just about the   time im going to sleep the phone tears off   the wall   uhhuh   uhhuh   and youre 
  trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on   umhum   or you hear somebody already starting   r   reading off a list of stuff that theyve   read probably a thousand times that day already   thats true   or the ones that are are generated by a computer   its just a computer voice that comes on the line   those are the ones that i really really hate too 
  even had   some of them   the   theyre voice activated and youve got to say hello twice before theyll do anything   uhhuh   uhhuh   yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine   at home   so and i hate that when ive got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them arent from anybody at all   what i would love to see done to stop all of this 
  uhhuh   weve got a thing in this country you can have your   phone number unlisted   umhum   i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think its great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything   but   if theyre going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just   go down every sequence of numbers for this   certain area code and call them   umhum 
  yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number   but i still get all of those calls   and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i dont even understand   so yeah i do i really feel that thats uh an invasion of my privacy   i agree with you on that particular subject there   let me see   thats about   that   as far as any other everyday occurrences   i put a stop to some of them as far as 
  the doortodoor   either religious groups or people   umhum   peddling products if i wanted their products i wouldve   either gone to the store to bought it or i wouldve   called for their s   salesman to come out   umhum   umhum   yeah thats true 
  living in an apartment complex though you know you cant um   you cant really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations   uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around   so usually what i do is ill call the apartment manager   and tell him hey theres people coming around you know and theyre trying to sell something or or theyre from a religious organization   and i really hate that   i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago   and um   gosh it was about nine oclock at night too it wasnt even what i would   consider you know a family hour its time to you know 
  start going to bed   and uh and it was somebody from um   oh what was it the uh   jesus christ of latter day saints   and uh ive read a lot about uh that particular sect and i dont particularly care for it   so i especially dont like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me   now i agree with   their right   to um   pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be 
  in a house or in an apartment   umhum   im on my   turf if i want   them there   ill call for them otherwise i dont want to know they exist   right   yeah   yeah   no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then thats fine with me too 
  you know as long as they dont try and pull me in and drag me in   and and i dont like the way that they do it either   and and its their   mission as they do as they go doortodoor and they go out into the public and they actually have   the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army   and two years in going around and doing missionary type work   and i dont know i just um i just dont particularly care for that at all   and that thats one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations   and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or   you know become interested in their religion 
  because i have my own   now the part about where you said   the apartment complex   puts up signs that says no soliciting ive even gone so far as to   put that ive got a storm door on the front of the house and ive put in   i dont know how much clearer it can be its a   red sign with   silver letters saying no soliciting i should have g i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still   get   yeah yeah thats true yeah no i dont uh i dont have 
  i didnt go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i dont have a storm door but im sure i could   rig up something   but you know i dont think that that would stop people   i mean its like th they see that word and it says uh go   instead of stop   oh goodness   wonder if thered be some way we could get   these people that do this get their names their addresses and their   phone numbers and then reverse it and   do well that would be technically illegal itd be harassment 
  oh gosh   but i consider invasion of my privacy   yeah   yeah   a harassment in itself   yeah   yeah   yeah thats true   thats true   hm 
  well what else   i believe weve   pretty much summed everything up   i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think   you talked about   the telephone calls   people coming and soliciting selling things at the door   you said something else   and i cant remember what it was   and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right 
  there but   we got uh we got to talking about the um   uh people coming to you at the front door   im drawing the blank   oh goodness   okay   is our five minutes up   uh pretty close to it well ive enjoyed talking with you   pretty cl   well it was nice talking to you too jim 
  and take it easy now   good night   okay thanks   bye   okay   we just bought our first home   after being in school and so were just first time   homeowners whove only been living here about six months   oh   okay um 
  well ive lived in the in the dallas and richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years   oh boy   and were in our second home now   weve been in it for uh   about thirteen   fourteen years i think now   in richardson   uhhuh   oh so   y youre an old pro then 
  weve lived in the richardson area for that   you know for the full time   uh   umhum   well what do you find having to be like out there ive   always heard that it was expensive   well its its not really all that bad uh i think   you live in plano so   uh the uh the   plano area and the richardson area probably are 
  are about the same   pricewise i would think   umhum   oh really   hm   yeah so   well we uh when we   graduated from school in houston uh my husband w went to school at rice and got his phd so that   thats what brought us here and um   we had um 
  heard a lot about richardson being a good area   and the homes there being really nice and   but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range   yeah   yeah   well   um   i know i   i think   that theres some areas in 
  you know   in uh richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but   uh of course it like i said ive   its been thirteen years since weve   really priced a house so   umhum   so im not sure what the prices are like now   uh i know that our pri that the   the value of our house went up   you know considerably o over a 
  you know uh   oh an eight or ten year period   yes   umhum   but then for the last several years its pretty well stabilized uh and   perhaps even dropped back some   from what it was so   really   hm   but uh 
  weve done uh you know in order to maintain ours weve done some remodeling and stuff you know just to   to kind of change   do some   some little changes occasionally so   yes   uh   but uh   i guess   im im a little encouraged with home prices i   im a cpa and i was just talking to one of my clients uh 
  yesterday   uh or you know over the last couple of days   well that makes sense   and they have sold a house that was   quite expensive and bought one you know that was   was more reasonably priced   its uh in dallas but its in the   richardson school district   umhum   hm 
  and   the the   lady   is very pleased you know she says its got everything she w   you know   thinks shell ever want in a house and it was   several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so   oh thats good   so i i suppose that the housing market is uh   you know it is on the 
  on the down side right now   well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um   foundation problems that seems to be the   pretty much the rule out here   well im not really aware of those i do know that   that our house uh   weve had to have the shower pan   in the master bedroom replaced twice   hm   because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under 
  that   uhhuh   but that was a design problem because we   put   uh and we designed the house so its our fault but   we had them put   the shower   on a corner   uh like our house is built in a u shape   and in 
  inside that u but on one of the corners   uh is where that shower is   umhum   and so   any shifting in the foundation of course   or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that   that that shifting would cause   some problems in that   in that area of the house   yes 
  and of course the shower pan is a   pretty   fragile piece of   uh of   metal or plastic whichever it is   anyway so   so   did it   look cracked to you i mean thats how you knew it was broken or   no it uh it started leaking through the 
  you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and its soaking up in the sheetrock   or in things   right   oh   oh   so thats   thats how you knew   well since like i say were first time homeowners im   still   scared about everything like that 
  going wrong and   how do you know its going to happen and all   yeah   uh   but uh   yeah   but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location   richardson plano are probably comparable the   the school districts are   you know are about the same 
  uh   you know   quality wise   umhum   we really like our school out here   yeah so   but we um   we were scared to buy a an house   in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems   and we didnt know 
  um you know if we were afraid wed be living there and all of a sudden the house would   crack in half and split open or something   umhum   yeah   but uh   well   our house and im not sure how all of the b   you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh   post   tensioned 
  which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation   umhum   hm   and once they get the foundation poured then they   they apply tension   to that   iron bar which compresses the concrete   and makes it   more   uh s more stable and and 
  puts more strength into it   umhum   so uh   you know it it   uh potentially thats supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the   you know when the   the earth itself shifts around   so   well thats good   well thats really good well our house is older its like a nineteen sixty three 
  yeah so   house that we bought so   im not   doesnt seem like it um   i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years   umhum   yeah   right   uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam   its slab 
  yeah so thats and thats what ours is   our h the house we had before was over we live on the east side of richardson now   and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh   a pier and beam house   umhum   umhum   and uh   i just drove by there this morning and it still looks   just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so   well thats good 
  yeah so   you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if youve got a   if you have a good builder   yes   my grandfather was a builder and so   my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew   they were getting a good deal   so   yeah   well i uh appreciate that information about 
  richardson i know it was um   its got a really good reputation and   okay   yeah so   well it uh you know i think its a   a good place to live uh or course if i didnt think that well   we wouldnt still be living here so   fourteen years thats pretty good   well thank you   and well um 
  you g good luck with this program then   byebye   right yeah that would   okay thank you uh   okay thank you you too   hello   this is lois   hello   hi   hi this is lisa 
  and um   i called you know from that the the ti database calling instructions   umhum   yeah i got a call yesterday too this is a different subject though   yeah this is about changes in   women in the   umhum   uh theres really a lot isnt there i mean there really is   yeah   ts kind of an easy thing to talk about 
  oh   i guess the work force would be the main wouldnt it   it   uh   yeah   um   i think you have to push one and then we can start recording it   okay   all right   are you ready now 
  okay   like i said i guess it would be the work force you know as far as changes in   the generations   okay   yes   yes i know because   i know when my mother was a   you know going into the work force there wasnt very many opportunities for her i guess shes in her late forties   you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids   and ive never faced that at all 
  um   no i think n now you go to work when theyre six weeks old   you know and you stay there   and i feel like   the next generation youll probably just work right along with your husband you know   uhhuh   yeah   umhum   i think its definitely gotten better   oh i do too much and its just gonna get better 
  it really is   umhum   because women are in every field now i mean i cant think of a field that theyre not involved in   oh i cant either not a one   i know at least in the medical field it seems like theyve come out with a lot further advances as far as female   medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field   i dont think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing   umhum   yeah   even in washington 
  you know there seems to be   lot more women involved   yeah   hopefully the next generation it wont even be an issue i mean people will just   look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best   goal   yes   yes   oh i do too just your qualifications and that would be it   uhhuh 
  exactly not what color you are how old you are what   if your male or female   that would be wonderful   i guess its kind of an ideal world though huh   yes   yeah   yes   um   yeah   yeah 
  i kind of think maybe in time that   you know   youll go by social security numbers   you know and that way they cant say well they   picked the male over a female or female over a male   you know you   yeah   yeah   yeah   exactly or 
  the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything   i think thatd be a wonderful way to do it   yeah   theyll just   i do too   just go by your social security number and then look at your qualifications that you know that you have   umhum   and then   and if you get it you know then   umhum 
  also with uh   women in the work force theyve gotten a lot more options as far as   you know whats it called job sharing   like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job   or   umhum   oh yeah   uhhuh   as a matter of fact thats what im doing   umhum 
  it sure is   it sure is   is it   that would be great   or   a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on loa to have her baby   we hooked up a a a terminal at her house   umhum   and sh you know we could send her messages and and she   kept in touch like that 
  and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh   every week or two   and that worked out great too   oh   uhhuh   yeah   yes that is   i mean thats a real attractive   option if you have the   the technology for it 
  all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and   she was   like she was sitting in the office   umhum   yeah   so i think thats real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing   oh   oh i do i really do i think its great   do you   do you work like half days or half weeks or 
  uh well like one week shell work   three days and ill work two and the next week you know ill work three and shell work two   we just share off like that   hm   oh is   oh thats great   uhhuh do you get the full benefits   umhum   yeah we get the   full benefits 
  but weve just really got a wonderful system that   were working under   yeah   oh thats wonderful   yeah especially with children and so many things going on   that would be great   yes   it really is and that way were not really missing anything out   you know   of those children uhhuh 
  either way yeah   you have your career and your home life   and thatd be a nice way to especially if you have young children   umhum   yes   oh it is   it is   well both of ours is school age but we dont want to miss any of those ptas and you know all of that so   so   umhum 
  oh no   i think yeah   my sons just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more   that youre involved in that   umhum   yeah   yes   i think its great i really   and i look for more of that in the next generation   yeah 
  i do too especially as women get up in management and and   can be in on those decision making   you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful   umhum   umhum   yes oh i do too   yes   plus i bet it cuts   cuts down on your absenteeism because youve got two days off that you can do everything   so you dont have to you know unless youre just really sick or the childs sick 
  but yeah   yeah because most time now you know its just a weekend or just forget it   ye   umhum oh yeah   i have to plan way in advance because or   what ive done is found like doctors and dentists office with extended hours   thats been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening   uhhuh   oh yeah   so thats real helpful so you dont 
  you know have to do it   during office hours run out on your lunch hour   i dont know how many times ive done that to do something   post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand   to do yeah   umhum   yeah i think weve really come a long ways in that because   yes   so   uhhuh 
  i guess i take it for granted kind of because i just its always been that way   but i know   umhum   yeah but i can remem remember back growing up my mother i mean it was   she always worked but it wasnt that easy for her to just take off   oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didnt make hardly anything   you know compared to the work that she did   oh   yes   umhum 
  where oh yeah   yes   i think theres still some discrimination   there where as you know men and wor women work in the same job i think men get paid more   but i think thats improving   its such a slow process its frustrating but   oh i do too   yes   yes   yes 
  mean you can see that its wrong and you just wanna make it right   but   at least the wheels are moving forward   umhum   they really are   yeah   i think its getting better not worse   well   i should probably get back to my job   i know i know the feeling 
  well it wa   okay and i sure will and byebye   call again   okay byebye   uh do you have a pet randy   uh yeah currently we have a poodle   a poodle miniature or uh full size   yeah   uh its a miniature   yeah 
  i read somewhere that the poodle is one of the the most intelligent dogs uh a around   well um i wouldnt uh i definitely wouldnt dispute that i its its actually my wifes dog uh i   i became   part owner six months ago when we got married but uh   it uh   definitely responds to uh to authority   and   ive had dogs in the past   and uh   it seems it seems to uh respond real well i it she shes picked up a lot of things uh just just by uh 
  teaching by force i guess is what id like to say   oh uhhuh   so you youve only known the dog wh how long did you say th   well about a year i guess   oh well   uh is it uh uh   how old is the dog   it just turned two i believe   oh its still just a pup   pretty much yeah yeah 
  yeah i have a uh   well a mutt myself i call it a uh   a chowpherd   okay   its uh part chow and part shepherd   and it as i understand it uh both sides of the were   thoroughbreds   so shes a genuine chowpherd   oh that sounds interesting   she has the 
  the color and the black   t   tongue of a chow   but uh she has the cha the shape of a uh uh   shepherd   oh thats thats neat   how uh about how big then   oh she weighs in at about fifty pounds so shes a medium size   okay   yeah yeah 
  but shes   big enough to be intimidating   it is a fi   a fixed female by the way   most definitely   yeah   and right from day one she was teaching me   oh i wouldnt doubt it yeah   she is shes the most intelligent dog ive ever seen   course im 
  little prejudice of course   well thats understandable yeah thats uh   no the first time i brought her home she was only uh   was it six weeks old   and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area   uhhuh   but uh next morning   she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom   okay   so on next night i spread the newspaper in the bathroom and she used them there 
  oh   but it wasnt too long till she uh   found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning   yeah   and since then uh ive i live alone   okay   and uh   i live in a motor home by the way im uh   an rv   full time rver 
  i see   and   its   its such a pleasure to come home at night and sh you can see her smiling from ear to ear shes so happy to see me   yeah definitely   and uh i dont know if you get that kind of greeting or not   yeah i can honestly say we do um   we uh   just recently put a security system in our house   and so now uh 
  in order to uh   to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her uh   uh locked up in the the master bedroom   during the day and then shes got the the bedroom and the bathroom   to for free run during the day but   uhhuh   weve always got a got a nose and a tongue pressed up against the window uh when we come walking up to the front door shes definitely ready to get out and r   run around   well my dogs an outdoor type she does not like to be indoors   really 
  uh   shed rather sl sleep outside on the the cold ground at night   oh wow   but uh i do   make her come in   yeah   and i feed her indoors thats to lure her in   but during the day i have her on a uh   on a leash   okay 
  which is uh on sort of a run i have a   a thirty foot   cable   okay   running from one stake to another and then attached to that is a uh   twelve foot leash   so she can cover quite an area   okay   most definitely   and uh shes the best uh 
  burglar alarm going   yeah   yeah the   yeah thats a   thats a definite security involved in uh in a dog like that   oh yeah she uh   its the strangest thing though   uh children   no matter how strange they are or how new they might be   can uh walk right up to her 
  umhum   but adults   if theyre strange to her or or they look suspicious or something   boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off   wow   thats uh   and i have not   discovered yet where the the line is between children and adults   yeah thats interesting   but sh uh she is a great comfort to me 
  yeah i kn i know our dog has had uh   had some different reactions shes never really been around children and uh   if   if the child is is pretty straight forward   um   shes fine   i if a child is a little intimidated shell jump around and and   yip and bark quite a bit and if the child gets scared   uh shes still trying to play but she doesnt completely understand whats going on and   weve had a little confusion w with uh with younger kids 
  uhhuh   but uh you know thats its a matter of exposure really   um   we uh took her home   to uh my familys place in south dakota   and she was the one that was intimidated then there was about seven kids ranging from about   oh   three years to ten years running around the house all at one time you know come to visit grandpa and grandma   and the dog kind kind of felt out of place then because she was   she was being fed and everything else from all directions she really didnt know how to handle herself so 
  uhhuh   what you mean she didnt appreciate all that attention   she really did she just uh   she she was alm she was just   inundated with with all the attention uh she she kind of she kind of sat and and soaked it all in for a little while and then shed go get back in and try to play and and whatnot but uh   it was it was just su such a new experience for her shes only been around   one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh   uhhuh   whats her name by the way   uh pardon 
  what uh what do you call the dog   oh its uh mitzi   mitzi   yeah mine is gin   yeah   oh okay   as in uh martini   yeah   actually its gin two   i see 
  because uh when i was a teenager in high school i had gin one   but then when i went out in the world i   couldnt take her with me   yeah   yeah   yeah i had uh i had a similar uh experience i   i grew up on a farm so i always had uh outdoor pets   uhhuh   and uh the dog i had   when i moved to dallas about five years ago was a uh 
  springer spaniel black lab cross   and he was a real   a real lovable type but uh   definitely not an apartment type animal   so he uh he had to stay home   oh yeah   ah what a shame   yeah   yeah it really was it   he uh apparently had a tough time with it 
  for a little while then he he got   he   came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on but uh   umhum   oh well   yeah   well randy weve just about used up our time here   and i must say it was interesting i enjoyed talking about pets with you   okay   most definitely 
  well thats great   maybe well get together again in the future   that sounds real good   take care now   bye   you too   bye   hi   hi   um 
  okay what   now uh what particularly   particularly what kind of music do you like   well i   mostly listen to popular music   i uh   listen to it all the time   in   in my car so i i tend to be one of those people who switches   stations a lot because i dont like commercials 
  but   uh i find myself listening to popular music and   yeah   uh quite honestly i   i have some little children and ive   unfortunately found myself listening to a lot of uh   nursery rhyme music here lately but thats not by my choice   how about you   oh really   well 
  um   i dont have that i dont have that   uh experience to   share   uh i i i do i do listen to a lot of   you know i do   i switch the   st stations a lot because i dont have a cassette player in my car   um   lucky you 
  umhum   uh however i d i do   i do like a a lot of different forms of music so i switch   quite often   um   i i think i like uh   i   im really particular about the type of music that i listen   to   but 
  the   uh th   theres such a wide selection i think i like a lot   umhum   or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music   you know i i i   i   i like music that is   that that i feel if its performed correctly or if its done right or   if the version is 
  done right i like it but   if   it if its not then i wont   i i really dont   yeah   how do you feel about rap   music it seems to be so popular these days   rap   yeah   well i i dont really have anything against 
  rap music   i   d   the one thing i do object to   about rap music is   is i   umhum   when it becomes militant   or if its uh violence oriented   i im 
  i i r i have i have strong objections to that   um   umhum   right   actually i listened to   one time i member its this is back when   r even   uh   i would say about ten or fifteen years   ago 
  i   when it was really just starting   yeah   yeah right when it was just starting i heard   what was called talking blues   which actually is   rap   and uh it was about the the piece of mus   the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old   and it was incredible i mean the parallels 
  you know between it and rap   uhhuh   uhhuh   right   and um   you you listen a lot if you l if you l hear a lot of old gospel   um   uh   especially well the black gospel   you know you will 
  you know you can really pick it up   i mean it   y   yeah you really   it   seems to be influenced by a lot of different music   a lot of times youll hear   songs   that   you know 
  theyre not original   but have been put to a rap   kind of a rhythm   yeah   and uh   sounds   th sounds so much different and yet i i have a a   much younger sister who   listens to a   a lot of rap music and 
  yeah   uh she   thinks its   pretty funny how often i know   all of the words to songs that   shes listening to   and yet she thought they were brand new   original pieces   yeah   yeah 
  they they do copy   versions   they do cover versions of   of   you know   like standards i guess you could call it   yeah so i think its kind of absurd you know the fact that   you know they dont really   they dont really   thats right 
  give   you know the original artist or the original composer the credit thats really due to them   no   yeah i guess there was even a   a bit of a   ruckus caused by the   mc hammer whos really   you know   seems to be the hot one of   of today he 
  used um   yeah   wild   thing do   you remember that   that song   he used   i cant remember who the artist was on that   yeah   umhum 
  yeah it jimi hendrix was the original   jimi hendrix was the original he wrote   who   was it   well   may   maybe it wasnt that one then because its a living   it was a living person that im that im thinking of   that   um 
  that said   you know hey   okay   thats those are my words   and uh i guess   that theyre   they   because he hadnt   originally gotten   um 
  permission from him   to use it   and he he since then has has   amended that and   umhum   paid them his royalties every time the   the song goes on but   yeah i dont know it mayve   it mayve been somebody else because i th i think that even   jimi hendrix did a 
  i think that was a cov i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version   of   like a   john lee hooker song or something i mean it was like   it was   really old   maybe so i   i cant think   i mean i i   it it a l therere a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of 
  times i mean ive heard some   songs   that   that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and im like you know i i dont wanna listen to this   because you know you think of the original its like you know oh that was really great that was a   you know   yeah   really good piece of work and   then y when you hear the cover its like you know god you know what   what are they doing to this 
  oh i th i think a good one was um   there was a peter frampton song   well right they destroyed it   oh yeah   y and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was   absolu it was pitiful   i   i remember seeing the video of it on mtv and i thought it was hideous   it was   oh 
  i didnt like that either   yeah theres   yeah but   you know   whatever became of peter frampton i mean there was nothing   he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into   you know great stardom or anything   i remember i   saw him in a concert when i was   yeah yeah i i think i think that prob 
  yeah i think that probably what   did it for him was the fact that he was a   good stage performer   i was in high school   umhum   he was very goo i remember i saw him in a   huge stadium in   um   philadelphia it was in jfk stadium it was   i dont 
  remember   yeah   oh man   hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like   yeah ive   i i graduated back in seventy nine so   but   but i really i i loved   i mean i was   umhum 
  i was really into the album oriented music   even then   so i was   really familiar with a lot of   with a lot of the aor type music   um   the the album oriented like   the   uh james   taylor and 
  umhum   oh yeah   the uh the beatles and   you know i mean a lot of people they go you know theyre better than the beatles and im like you know you you dont know what youre talking about   hm no   oh   oh i mean you know   c the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles i mean   it was just   you can only laugh 
  yeah you just sort of you know   well i guess i can just humor them you   know at this point but   right   well   they i guess   w ou our age is showing when we   when we think that   yeah but we well you know i mean i ive   i liked a lot of the new music i think um 
  um when   i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave   when it when it came out   um   back in the   umhum   yeah   in the mid and early eighties and then   um   i dont know music is kind of in a weird 
  it it its in a very weird position right now i think that   i mean i like   you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music   which is   you know using all these natural forms   of music and   yeah yeah paul simon well   you know really thats not world music   but   w what paul simons doing i think is is is is great because 
  hes   like paul sim   yeah   uh you know i think i think that   you know using   a i guess what they call it is eclectic   you know u   drawing from a lot of different sources   and making you know a   a synthesis of a new type of music 
  um   yeah   what do you mean by world music   well world music is   um   a lot of   the   a lot of   where they where they make   music that they adapt 
  to a   to another kind of   to another type of   listener   uh for example lets say youre taking like an original brazilian form   of music   umhum   a with a certain style   and   then you try to make it 
  a little bit more listenable for   lets say another audience lets say a north american   and then when they   hear it it   it   its a really its another form of music and   you know its sort of   um trying to draw out the best sources   the the best of every type of music   uhhuh 
  huh   right   because i mean there are some   i mean i l there are some   you know types of   heavy metal that i really like but   but   i wouldnt   i wouldnt say that i i completely like heavy metal   i i think 
  you know i and its the same way with   w you know world music takes   no   the forms that have really been   um   i guess   i you know the best example or   you know   the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then   and then taking those 
  those qualities   and then applying in the styles   that are really   um   that extremely enjoyable   and then taking   so then it becomes a kind of music o of its own   so to   speak or   hm 
  yeah   yeah it becomes a kind of music of its own i mean   when you listen to it   its um   uh   i think that   they dont use elec   el   some of it its its they use electronic and acoustic   interchangeably 
  uhhuh   so   you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa   now   and from   west africa   thats considered world music because its not particularly   using   certain types of folk styles   right 
  but   theyre theyre trying to make it   somewhat more modern   i i a a good ex another good example was   i heard miles davis   and miles davis worked with ravi shankar   if you can believe it   i mean   you know hes this jazz performer and then hes   playing with ravi shankar whos a very good 
  uhhuh   uhhuh   hes a very good arranger uh   arrangement   to   but   uh were going to get off   i dont know   but   no 
  yeah okay   but   yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and its just incredible   they are they trying to stop   putting in a little interfer   okay weve talked our five minutes though   oh ive been listening to that a lot lately   yeah i i listened and i heard   you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this   the muted trumpet and i mean you never th would think that they that they can actually play together but 
  go together y   okay so   um   yes we do keep   uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a   computer   here at the house and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year   using   all of our   our checkbook 
  to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under   for each month   uhhuh   uhhuh   and then   basically since then   what ive done is is keep track of it through the checkbook   so that   based on   whatever weve got coming in check 
  coming in and   how much im spending each   half of the month   and then trying to also   sp   and because our house payment is once a month   thats our our biggest uh expense so i take   half of that   amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck   even though its really still there 
  uhhuh   uhhuh   so that i   can keep a   a   good balance running total   yeah through the month   what do yall do   a running total   yeah 
  uh weve   weve uh   taken how much we have   you know write down how much   we have coming in each month and then uh   weve at the beginning of the year we sat down and   determined how much we could spend we sat d made up different accounts like   you know   weve set a budget for each   you know household expenses or food and clothing and 
  entertainment and then our our own fun money and   just stuff like that and then   we write down each   each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close weve   you know we we try to stay within a certain budget   so   umhum   is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well   um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it   it works out real well 
  so   umhum   and and youre staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good   uhhuh   yeah   yeah i stay w i have to stay within it so i   yeah   i foun   you know and then we have that you know if   you cant stay if something comes up and you cant stay within it then 
  we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and   some un unexpected comes up then youre not   umhum   yeah   you know you dont feel it so strapped   you dont have to go out and borrow it somewhere and   and do that   right yeah because we dont   you know we dont   charge anything that we cant pay off by the end of the month 
  yeah   thats a good choice weve been trying were trying to uh   do that this year weve budgeted   the money that we used to spend we were spending on a coda account   with ti and then   money we were also buying stock with   for that year weve taken that   this year and said were gonna pay off   all of our credit cards   and uh 
  uhhuh   you got paper under your table   uhhuh   we have a   another   loan with the bank   and so we hope by the end of this year   that by doing that well be   free   and clear 
  uhhuh   to be out of debt   free   yeah the only thing we have it   to pay off is our   is a automobile loan and   our house payment and thats the only thing we ever   we try to stay out of debt so   yeah   thats good to be in that kind of shape 
  what are yall trying to do long term   uhhuh   oh as long term   we just he h you know his retirement plan and then   to coda and stuff like that thats all weve   and you know we just have our life insurance for right now   uhhuh   so   we dont have any long term   you know in 
  stocks or anything like that right now so   yeah   mostly what were doing weve worked   weve done the uh coda account with ti where they   we put in so much a month and then they   or so much a paycheck and then they   match it   yeah thats what were doing   so   and so that 
  that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for ti and i have   when i retired from there or   left   i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an ira   and we had an out   yeah   uhhuh   we had an existing ira so we have   both of us have   some money in an ira that were also trying to 
  figure to   put it were putting it in cds right now and then were also   looking at it   in possibly getting a   mutual fund   uhhuh   yeah whenever we get   enough saved we we stick it in a cd for a while and then uh   umhum   you know 
  and then when we if we need it we wait till it its expired and then   so   yeah   the other thing that weve done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies   um   han oh   john hancock company   came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on   salary   and uh what we were pla what 
  what what our   uh goals were   on a long   term budget in terms of retirement   kids college   paying off the house buying a different house   uhhuh   um special thing buying land and building our own house   and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame   that we wanted to look at 
  uhhuh   and then gave us a good idea back   you know some good   information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals   and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in   at   what time   or not yeah   uhhuh   that sounds interesting weve never done any we have 
  you know just our   our life insurance guy has come out you know and hes set up uh   you know determined how much we need to   umhum   you know we need if something were to happen   umhum   yeah that   you know   thats the other financial thing   i guess 
  that weve done is with our life insurance is   since im at home now is is figuring out uh   what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me   yeah   right   yeah y you know if i would   sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldnt stay in texas i would uh   thats a a big thing to think about   sell the house and move back   home 
  you know to my home town and   and uh i wouldnt stay here in texas so   umhum   yeah   you know   i dont know what he would   do   but   okay   i guess thats most of my 
  um financial plans right now is is there anything youd like to add   yeah mine too   nope thats about all for mine   kay well its been nice talking to you   nice talking to you too   byebye   byebye   all right   okay   uh 
  weve got a lot of them   too many of them   oh yes   and i believe we all do   and and its just   too easy to use   yeah well my husbands real good at using them   oh i   believe that uh mine would say the same   uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much 
  i dont have any of them i dont carry them he carries them   i try to take them away from him   um   it uh   you know i seem to uh   use those more than i do cash   in fact id rather carry   the cards than i would the uh cash   yeah   well we got in a 
  spot of trouble with uh   using uh the credit cards on gas   uh   yes   and uh   thats got us in trouble   yes thats uh real easy to do i have to watch it   yeah   in fact yeah   uh we i can understand that predicament 
  um   they theyve um   you know theyve theyve made them too easy   to and   too accessible   at everything   to to buy   the atm machines   oh   yes 
  those things there thats what gets us   and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down   well no he doesnt have that trouble   he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh   atm machine   and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records   oh uhhuh   oh thats good   but uh   he knows when hes overspends and when he doesnt and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card 
  you know   ive   used the credit card a couple times to pay bills   oh   yeah   yes   uh   and then then   that gets into a vicious circle   yeah 
  as far as   you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan   yeah thats what hes talking about doing now   oh no   um   yeah the atms   theyre but   theyre nice though to have   in case you need to   get some quick cash 
  and everything is closed   yeah well   yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards   uh   i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me   oh thats the best way its used   thats the best way yes   now i think that   sort of   evens it out as far as uh 
  letting them carry it   so   as long as they do buy us something   yeah   i dont know i like that he walks in you know and hes got this little gift and howd you pay for it   credit   he you know   said whipped out my little card   and see theres no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it   yeah 
  id never thought about that way i dont really look   i guess i ought to sometimes   oh i have to open it you know they   mine always charges the flowers so i can always   end up saying oh you spent too much you know   and so   yeah   well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a   nintendo   oh 
  those are fun   yeah   you get started on them and cant quit   like credit cards   oh no   never thought of it that way either   hes   you know hes addicted to it at times   just   exactly 
  oh its its real easy to get   addicted to them   you know you get out on a shopping s   frenzy and uh   just charge it all and then you dont have to write a check or anything   and see the thing is you know he go out and hell spend it   when he wants you know and uh   uh   im afraid to   im afraid to use that credit card 
  yeah   i there is a   a fear to it as far as   what happens if   yeah   you know uh   is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and   hes not a yeller though but   he calmly you know you shouldnt have spent it all on that   yeah 
  they   he likes to buy the kids toys   with the uh   credit card too   y you know hell go to   by   walmart or something and   oh yeah   thats it   oh yeah theres thats a weakness there 
  thats just   you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh   you dont care how much it costs or what it takes   yeah   well   uh   i dont know   the uh   uh   the 
  my   walmart   thats where all of our bills are for the credit card   uhhuh   yeah thats uh   i always end up going into walmart and   coming out with everything that uh   i didnt have on the list   were just getting more than what we went in for   but 
  we went in for uh   uh something for the car one day   the last week and he went we went and bought   a potty chair   uh   uh one of those ninja turtles for my son   uh   you know the potty chair for my daughter   and he bought the   uhhuh 
  a pair of shoes for me   and   uh   lets see   what else did   he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it   and uh   oh   yeah its dangerous   you know 
  we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up   sixty seventy dollars for uh at walmart and then we went to payless and bought the shoes for the kids   umhum   oh yeah   its just too easy to do you go in for just one thing   were   were infamous about that   and so   yeah ill second that   oh well 
  yeah i   well im   im glad we have credit cards thats uh   because in sometimes when theres an emergency it   it   comes in handy   yeah   its nice to have   i know we had the car break down one time and the   uh 
  credit card saved us   yeah   weve   yeah weve had uh   a sick animal and uh   the vet   you know   the dog and   vets are so expensive   that uh we uh 
  the credit card helped us a lot there too so   we wouldnt do without them   i dont think wed live   huhuh   no   no i think its become too much of an everyday life here   theyre part of it   yeah well   ive been asking my husband for the credit cards ive got all of them but one   i just hide them from him and 
  when i feel that its necessary to pull it out ill pull it out but he keeps one of them   he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh   uh what you call it   yeah no the uh   the balance   credit   line   you know uh the credit limit   i let him have the one with the least amount   oh yes uhhuh 
  so you know he cant spend too much   yeah you know uh i dont really exactly remember how much it is i think its about five hundred limit   uh   you know its just uh   just one for him to   fiddle with   yes umhum   i have to think of something else im   im blank   i was i was just uh 
  oh well lets see i guess   weve talked what   almost five minutes   well six minutes ive got a timer on my   uh   oh   clock on my phone   oh i wish i had one of those   well we bought this with credit too   well we found it with a clearance uh 
  down in memphis i guess and uh   oh see there you go   popped that credit card out   it was a sears   oh your up in memphis   no i used to be   im in texas   oh your in texas oh okay i was   i was going to go goodness they really got   uh this out far 
  well i   i dont know   i dont know how far it goes   yeah   yeah im down in houston   are you in texas   oh im in uh   down here in sherman   or denison rather   oh okay 
  yeah   umhum   well   oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had   first phone call   this is my first one too   uhhuh   my husband did one last night and he just loved it   hes been getting he got a real good topic   huh 
  so   well   uh   you know we got to get back to credit cards   yeah   well i was just trying to think uh   i think weve pretty much said it all   it   um but   so uh 
  but yeah uh   i   think we   couldnt make it without them   i know i couldnt uh   we went and   we maxed out quite a few of them   before uh   i started taking the uh   cards away 
  we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven   and we maxed them out   umhum   and uh   thats got us in a little bit of trouble now thats why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others   and that got that   in trouble there   yeah   yeah   but uh we uh 
  we try to keep a uh   tight controls over uh over them but it it gets hard like especially around christmas time and birthdays   uh uh   my hubby does not have uh   too much control when it comes to using that card   uh   i know uh   uh   for quite a while we was using them to uh   uh 
  i think even one time we used it to pay our rent   oh goodness   you know it uh   when we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and   we got in to too expensive of a house   or apartment rather and   uh   you know he was only down here for one day   uhhuh   uhhuh 
  and   we just everything just piled up   wrecked the car   and you know in order to   do that we had to you   know   we was   paying   oh   the rent plu try plus trying to get the money for an 
  ca another car   and   it gets rough   it got   it got real rough   thats hard   he just   popped out that uh master card and   get that cash advance uhhuh   yeah 
  we got a big cash advance and really   thats whats uh holding us back now thats   yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy   those   they do   theyre worth it   oh well   i i   think weve pretty much come to an end here   yeah 
  im trying to find out how long were supposed talk   i think it was at least five minutes wasnt it   thats what im looking for now thats why i was   just trying   talk without having to think about what i was saying   and uh   trying to look over this thing   okay   wonderful touch tone telephone there   uh what 
  kind of books do you enjoy reading   uh having   have uh   i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my   my reading pleasures are quite wide um   i get a charge out of uh texas highway   uh which uh is very colorful and   uh not being a native of texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to   uh   find out the uh 
  oh   about the different areas of   of the k of the   state by reading it   right ive read that one too i   only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i i really enjoyed   you know all the little   things that you find out about texas   oh yeah its its uh absolutely its great the way that its broken out and   you can uh 
  set up little trips and day trips and things its pretty pretty neat   um   oh i like photography   um   magazines i dont   take a subscription or anything like that   um   things   oh   being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of 
  a lot of uh   building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and   read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and   uhhuh   and uh   kind of strange because ill   its not unusual to uh   see um   an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then ill sit up and read just to refresh uh   you know to keep active on it but uh 
  how about yourself   uhhuh   well   um   i have an interest in art so i   frequently   purchase and read   um books mainly on water color because thats   my   big interest at the moment 
  umhum   oh thats great   and um   oh i guess i like a variety of things um   lots of fiction   uh type   books   um right now im   occasionally   reading on a book about uh 
  the mardi gras in new orleans and its history   thats fairly interesting   umhum   i bet that would be rather interesting uh   thats uh   selfimprovement thats thats alw well   thats   thats kind of a hobby but it is selfimprovement   uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing   um 
  yeah   i i dont know that i read anything strictly labeled selfimprovement   how about you   um   well i hate to   yes i do   we um   we have these classes we attend uh   management classes then and they give you books and   and the last book uh matter of fact i read was 
  at americas service   by carl   albridge   it talks about   um   who the customer is and being customer oriented   uh which   falls in line with the ti culture here at texas instruments   yeah   um 
  one of its great slogans is if youre not serving the customer   you better be serving someone who is   uhhuh   uh so thats all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is   and as you probably well know   all of us   are our own customer your my customer im your customer sort of thing   um   right   every now and then im loaned the tape 
  i can stick in the   in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable   talking about   uh   better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of   pat haggerty and these kind of   uh   mind stimulating philosophy type   yeah   actually which all you know betters yourself 
  yeah   yeah   well i   g maybe i   am into some things occasionally that i   dont think of in terms of selfimprovement   umhum   i mean they are but   i dont label it as such   like what for example 
  well   i dont know um   i uh   have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh   i guess not so much   books although they sometimes have manuals and things   but um   they would   be things on like how to be successful and   sort of talking to yourself 
  you know g getting your   yourself in gear to   umhum   uh sort of   pull yourself up by your boot straps and   do what you   really wanna do   convincing you that you need to   get on with it   sure 
  sure   how about items like um   the one minute manager   which used to be a big   okay   so those are self improvements   um   yes   sure   our supervisor uh 
  suddenly bought all of us a book called   what every supervisor should know   um   by a main man named   uh doctor bittel   b i t t e l   and its a very laymans   uh   uh approach towards managing different types of people   and the very last chapter and i havent figured out why that one was last 
  is how to manage engineers   so its   its ver its interesting here again its its casual reading and its not eaten up with a lot of uh   technical stuff and its really   uh excellent fast reading and uh   but as you say its   its sometimes its difficult to to know if its   you know i think if somebody wants to say kay read these ten books because these are selfimprovements   i would probably be turned off to them   yeah 
  yeah   he casually just walked into it and uh   put down a stephen king book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting   i dont know i im not sure i could take too much of stephen king   thats a li little   little heavy for me   yeah theyre uh quite   uh theyre hard to set down because its so interesting and   course theyre always a little spookier than the movies but uh   yeah 
  its always   theyre always   challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books   well i guess i also have been reading uh   a lot of things on   uh quality improvement and that   type of thing because thats   what im   involved in a lot at work   umhum 
  in quality pecially nowadays uh   thats almost everything that comes across the   the the   the the airways of th   oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other   but i   think sometimes the word is a little over used but   exactly exactly right   yeah w we have i think we we name drop it   a little too much and and dont fully understand what 
  wh what it is were saying i think its its focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and   and all that kind of rolls in together there   but uh   yeah   yeah   yeah   thats kind of part of it   okay well   any other   comments 
  uh   not that i can think of   um   i think im under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two   well we just started right   ah this is true   ive enjoyed it   well you too and   uh   ha 
  goodbye   have a good day   byebye   goodbye   all right amy how are you doing today   fine   fine   oh   all righty i think we know what were going to speak about   um 
  tell you what ill start off hows that   yeah   okay you go ahead   um   i personally think   to set a mark   with the judicial system   and were talking about criminals   criminal cases that they should   bring back 
  umhum   hangings   on weekends   in public places   in public places   there is one state that does that by the way   yeah   really what is that   i want to say oklahoma i saw re   something the other night about it 
  hm   they dont do them real often   which is obviously the death penalty   yeah   yeah   um   but i think if we quit   uh building these taj mahals   with the color tvs   and sixty doll sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them 
  and get it over with   and lets just quit screwing up the system   uh   yeah   well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time   a sentenced murderer   you know is in jail is two years before hes paroled   and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months   thats pathetic   thats pathetic i 
  because they just say theres   either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or   you know its just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway   on what hes going to   you know sentence someone for   between   you know two months and uh fifty years and   you know   whats his whim to decide it should be two months   this is true 
  a a a   and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to   you know its crazy   life in prison then hes available for parole   if its if its life and a day then hes not   eligible for parole   so what   you know lets quit bsing with the system   yeah   well even if its life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life 
  we could spend that money you know for s children that are starving or   twelve million other things would be more useful than that   exactly   so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really   a life for a life   i mean there are so many just   major major serial murders and   its not just like   you know one instance or something its just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on   the old charles manson case i mean the guy is really 
  yeah   and   the yeah theres just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um   just shouldnt be allowed to to even   even   live   uh   about   the issue about sentencing by the judge   yeah 
  umhum   the   the judge presently has an opportunity to   intervene   uh   when theres uh   my understanding when theres uh a verdict and it for example theres a hung jury here in fort worth two day in   eight to four   and bam bam the guy got off   uh he was uh he 
  he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay   right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah   um   kind of gets back to the second request weve been asked to look at   is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict   the a situation like that id say no   lets just go like a regular vote   eight to four tells me that there were eight   theres a per certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people   uh seventy percent of the people said hey 
  right   rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to   you know go back to court and all the lawyers and   i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a   f you know a fortune to keep doing that   the guys guilty   exactly   and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution   exactly because its not   next day they have the 
  start the trial whi is x number of months and   just prolongs the situation that much more   right   yeah   yeah   i think that that if its an if its not a split decision   uh go with the highest number and lets just get on with the program   yeah   yeah   uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge 
  i would have to vote   against that   since theres a jury because thats what the juries are for is to make the decision   um   what are your feelings   yeah   yeah   well if i i   saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida and she just has   just really stiff penalties and i saw that in 
  in the hands of a judge that really   was conscientious and really   you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a   judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side   and have some judge that was paid off or   you know had   goo a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power   you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system   does something to prevent that   you know or help it with it anyway i dont know if it prevents it but 
  seems like the jury system does have its advantages   but i also ive also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know   and i dont know how much theyre getting   just a jury of their peers at that point theyre really getting a select group its not just random people   hm   it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and thats it   yeah   ye i get back to prices comment when he uh   was found guilty he said well he didnt have any blacks uh   you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break 
  you know   you know   hed have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like hes got his   peers or something   yeah   exactly   yeah   yeah i mean youre youre in dallas so everybody i cant believe they can   uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who dont know anything about the system well   or know anything about the the occurrence youd have to be 
  pretty dense   yeah   youd be in have to be in a cave not to know whats going on or moving it to lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer   yeah   oh theyd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically   this is true   so true well   this has been an interesting conversation   yeah   yeah 
  well really this is   breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no im at home with two little ki preschoolers   my husband works for ti   oh so youre at the house youre not at the plant   oh hold it   oh thats good thats good   i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasnt sure   so yeah   oh yeah ive got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room   okay thanks a lot 
  byebye   oh goodness   well ill let you get   i enjoyed it   bye   okay um i dont know about   you but where i   am   we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work and it varies like everyday i mean from   jeans 
  one day to   business suits the next   w   its pretty   bad but its   true   you know they tend to try to   be you   know real lax and supposedly the policy is like   you know 
  we you know we hire these   wonderful   creative   people and we   dont want to   smush   their creativity you   know we   want to go ahead and let   them 
  do   what ever they want and you know you really will   see people in   in jeans one   day and business suits the next   well im kind of that way too i work in the legal department and where we are now what were doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents   yeah   and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day it always seems like im doing that and i cant see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff   when you have to carry   you know boxes of documents around 
  so   if im just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know   odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents   i dress down   but if were going to have a meeting   where were having the attorneys come in or people from uh other partys attorneys and stuff then i normally dress up   yeah and ill wear a dress and hose and stuff   y   yeah   you know were kind of that way too i try to im the same way you are i kind of try to judge from day to day i know 
  you know where i am we work a lot with the customers and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time and   umhum   and you know if i know that theyre gonna be there   you know y you i try to really watch it and like you say you know really dress up and if i know theyre not   you know i ive been doing a lot of reorganization you know the last couple of months the same way you are you know and   its just so its just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress you know it is   so   umhum   thats right thats right   a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um 
  i was at ti the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through   two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across   the road and it wasnt air conditioned   uh   and   if we were there like in the middle of the summer its unairconditioned it was   dusty and dirty   um   there was   like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didnt really know we werent supposed to we thought ti dress code was just dress appropriate to your job 
  we wore shorts   we didnt know that was a big no no   uhhuh   oh no   and a supervisor from another area   came up to us   and   you know this   area where record retention is theres only a few people that work   there and he sh 
  he knew who worked there he should have realized that we   werent regulars in the warehouse there   uhhuh   and he came up to us and he just said whos your supervisor   well he called our supervisor and our supervisors supervisor and it went up   all the way to the head of facilities   complaining that we were wearing shorts   oh no   he didnt   at least say to us did you know youre not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big problem we ended up getting called out on it 
  oh how awful sounds like mister power hungry   but you know just yesterday though i   saw a girl in the spin out here at lewisville   that had on a pair of shorts   yeah   uhhuh   and i dont care you can call them split skirts   and you can call them culottes   all you want   but 
  these were shorts is all they were i mean i i dont care what else you call them you know if theyre below the knee okay maybe you can call them split skirts if theyre above the knee they turn into shorts you know   and these werent even really   full ones i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer wearing these shorts that were   you know the real wide   full ones you know   and because these werent even those these were like   umhum   pretty short   black and they were very dressy they were black   velvet shorts and she had on black hose and black heels and she looked very very nice 
  hum   but you dont wear shorts to work   you know i mean   as far as im concerned she was in violation and nobody says anything to them its   always been a big problem in lewisville in the   summertime   you know if they just   you know the management doesnt ever seem to want to take an   um   hum 
  cut off you know that   yeah no this is where were going to draw the line this   is shorts you know and and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that   you know   yeah   hum   so it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going well god we have a pair of those at home too it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear you know but   well ive seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use   the texteller machine   and they have said no 
  yeah   uh yeah and then during the week you see these women in the you know   just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesnt make them not shorts anymore you know   yeah   i mean ive never seen them do it without hose i mean they always have hose on but still its   theyre shorts i dont care what you say theyre shorts you know   well i think tis dress   code is pretty lax   considering   everything anyway you know i 
  i know i didnt know that eds has a very strict dress code i had a friend oh   oh do they really   definitely   i had a friend who worked there   for a year or so and   they   spell it out   for men   its particular suits   uh the pin stripe 
  and the particular colors of shirts   and win   wing tipped shoes   oh it is definitely lined out   oh my god   women are not allowed to wear slacks she wears coordinated suits   i coul i couldnt afford to work there   and a   and a particular kind of shoe you know so high heel oh it is   oh 
  no   spelled out   when i was looking at her   materials when she first started you know she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff and it told about the dress code and it said   uhhuh   these are the color pastel shirts you may wear or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and   hair just this way   yeah   ti says no shorts and no halters you know thats it   and eds is very particular about this hair cuts i mean 
  it was like you cant have you know such and such facial hair no beards you know and just   really detailed   wow   i dont know that that would be a good environment to work in i mean i   i see i i am more i dont know about anybody else and a lot of bosses may say im nuts but i am more productive   when im in pants   i i am i work faster i get things done faster than when im in a dress and heels you know i it and its weird but i   its i do i i can i can get so much more done   if im dressed comfortable   you know 
  well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because   we had   uh another person coming from washington our outside counsel   and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didnt get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse   right   and she came with skirts just like shed be going into the office   yeah   and wed try wed try to say   didnt you bring any pants or anything were were out here in the warehouse   you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and youre gonna have to un 
  unload your skids   look at the documents in the in the boxes and then   repack your skid   uhhuh   you cant do that in a skirt   poor   thing   and she   and she was so   she was so hot and miserable 
  you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but   you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her   oh yuck   yeah   thats terrible   thats terrible   gosh   well i dont know i just figure   you know yeah sometimes i worry about   you know if i go in in pants and i never i never ever ever go in in a pair of jeans you know 
  but ill go in in pants i mean today i had on a pair of you know navy blue dress slacks and a   and a like a   peach colored top and   you know not   cruddy but not a dress either   and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that would will hold you back you know if you dont dress in you know   your dress for success   business suits everyday if   umhum   you know if upper management doesnt notice that and remember that later on but 
  you know i dont know if they do or not you know i see a lot of the managers and theyre in   jeans so   you know   some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and its funny because   theres one that   always wears a suit a matter of fact hes never seen without his jacket to the suit on   buttoned   really   wow   and then theres another one whos whos 
  a little younger and a little more yuppyish and hes always kind of like in the khaki pants and   you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it   uhhuh   yeah   and some of the patent attorneys have been   real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt   so thats just   you   isnt that funny   you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so we 
  thats great   weve kind of had a variety there but   i think a lot of times its its mainly who theyre going to meet with theyre theyre meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then thats how they are   if there just gonna   be meeting with tiers   yeah   like to talk about a patent kind of thing   and the theyre engineers that theyre talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and theyre usually casual   thats the way to do it   i mean thats the smart way to do it 
  it really is   because your making you   know if when theyre meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down if they come in   you know in a six hundred dollar three piece suit   yeah   its gonna make the people theyre meeting with feel very uncomfortable   you know   or it would me you know   its its one of those slippery attorneys coming in here   yeah yeah look at this slick guy i wonder what kind of money does he make uhhuh 
  i can   see it now   well it was good to talk to you it   was really enjoyable   yeah this is   this is kind of a fun project ive done   ive   done some of the other speech programs but weve never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer   so this is a little different   it really is 
  oh yuck yeah   well its kind of enjoyable im really looking forward to it   well thanks a lot   byebye   yeah   okay   bye   okay   um   hows it been this week for you

  and the weather   and uh   think a lot of people have contracted   uh spring fever   too so   had a lot of people out at work   you know for fishing and   and uh golf reasons and things like that   the blue flu   yeah 
  yeah the blue flu   or the white collar flu depending on   where you work i guess   yeah   yes   oh we have had   uh as ive said weve had variable weather   uh   hm   it has been 
  untypically   wet   for   this time of year   hm   and also   we have a lot of   green   you know the grass has been growing and   if you look outside you 
  would like to go out and mow your lawn   if you could go out and   hm   buy a new spark plug or   something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh   do not have to   go out and buy the spark plug   no   but weve had an unusually uh   uh warm 
  yeah   spring   and well i guess were still in winter   and uh   umhum   we have had no snow   to speak of to speak of   no snow   hm   we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and 
  this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation   hm   so   its been inordinately warm   uh here   for uh for this time of year   so uh   in that regard its its fine   but uh   hm 
  umhum   i envy you youre at ninety four degrees i thought i heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday   yes   yes it is   down in uh   more southern an an western areas   and of course were   um   about two hours from the northern border   straight south and 
  yeah   and uh   very windy   its amazing to me because ive only lived in dallas three years   and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time   it does i i   i very seldom   if any   i cant remember you know a day that   i walked out and the wind wasnt blowing 
  umhum   well i spent six years in graduate school at   in indiana   in the flatlands   and it   was that way everyday   rarely a day went by when the wind was   less than   fifteen or twenty miles an hour   hm 
  summer   a and winter so   that uh we you you became accustomed to it i guess   but uh otherwise   uhhuh   w as i said we have had a uh   relatively mild   winter   f speaking for this area of the country   umhum 
  oh reall where did you go to school in indiana   purdue   purdue   i have a brother that lives in uh   uh southbend indiana   oh yes   and i had to   always   w ive lived there for eight years myself   id always said i was gonna go back to school and go to notre dame 
  but i didnt   uh   well you are not from   that area originally i   can tell   no originally im from new mexico   i was   born in new mexico and we lived in uh   southbend for eighty eight years and uh   then moved to uh tennessee actually 
  oh okay   well   umhum   well i thought i heard a little tennessee in   the   and uh   very much very much because i i spent thirteen years there   umhum   and uh then moved to dallas   about three years ago so 
  gee youve moved almost moved around as much as i have   yeah   its uh uh uh   uh my father was in the air force so   oh i see   well i worked for the government so i   i moved uh   uh   much more frequently than i had   intended 
  uh for sixteen years but   uhhuh   i guess the uh   th this is my first conversation in this uh uh   series   oh uhhuh   i h i received a call last night because of the uh   i had not received my uh personal identification number   right   so i had to call jack godfrey today and ask him what it was because i 
  i had to abort the call last evening because i couldnt get on the line   yeah   so   uh   is there any   im not sure how long were supposed to talk   its um   its just   as long as you want to   i mean its just a 
  oh okay   as long as you want to and just you know   a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for texas instruments uh   no i do not i work for gte   oh okay   and i   uh   of course was i was sent a uh   an application from uh from jack   ive known jack for sometime 
  im in the   umhum   speech processing business   and   have been for a number of years so   i was very much interested   oh r   yeah   in   in being a speaker for this 
  oh actu i i work for texas instruments and um   im in a   im an environmental engineer   oh i see   and uh   they just published this   internally   you   know   getting people 
  involved so th   thats   really strange i i was   wondering why we had   somebody from maryland though   i was   thinking god do we   have a ti in maryland or   umhum   im sure you have a representative somewhere in the area 
  just nothing more than a   business representative or government services representative   umhum   and um   but i have uh   i have been an a speaker in other   uh similar   type of activities   uh   and 
  i know the reason why this is   why the uh   this is being   umhum   gathered and the program and so   forth so   i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker   umhum   we havent talked much about the weather i know thats what were supposed to do   oh well 
  yeah   yeah   well really it uh   the the   letter just says   um   lets   see i cant   i was   looking 
  at it i was trying to   find   out   speedy   short cuts   and all it says not   necessary   to measure   your time just to   go 
  ahead   and   enjoy the   conversation   and   and end   it   when   needed   so 
  umhum   in environmental engineering   uh   okay   umhum   is that   with regard to workplace engineering or just   you know environment the work place environment or   uh   well its actually um 
  waste water   taking   taking care of uh   im actually in the air   division and we monitor um   oh i see   anything that   comes out of a stack   or out   of a building or 
  um   we do have customers that um   their   concerns   are   in the   work   place   and we   take care of 
  that but i within   umhum   our department we   uh take   care of everything waste   water   uh   solid waste   and   recycling 
  and   and   air   well i had my   the the call last evening was supposed to be about   uh concerning   recycling   in the community   the call i received   oh uhhuh 
  umhum   and so i had uh   i had thought a little bit about it   um uh   umhum   beforehand   oh uhhuh   so i   but th thats interesting i have a um   uh a friend who 
  is a planner   oh uhhuh   uh a city planner   and one of his and he models   uh city districts and so forth uh   does computer modeling   umhum   yes   and one of the uh   he has 
  inputs or gets inputs from a   an environmental engineer   uhhuh   yeah   we actually   our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the dallas area   course we have several plants here but   um   we do   air modeling 
  also   to   umhum   oh i see   and   and yeah i take care of all the air modeling   specifically for the dallas area   what we do we have a weather station   that we get all of this   information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction and 
  and uh we have a huge chemical data base   well thats interesting   and uh our   our chemical data   base   so that   we know every chemical on   site   and   and 
  um its concentration and   and if   if anything ever happened god forbid   you know   a building explosion or something like wed be able to track   chemicals from that building with our weather station   okay so weve got to talk about music   and um   do you like   classic rock or modern rock or which kind 
  okay   oh   i guess the stuff that was done more in the seventies   because thats   no not a seventies baby   well no thats really when i grew up so thats really what i like better is that kind of music i mean   is it disco or is it like   no no no not that kind of music   no more like   uh 
  rock   um   you know like led zeppelin type   but   oh okay   so so they can get like the doors and led zeppelin   yeah thats cool   and how about the rolling stones   right   right 
  oh sure sure i went to their concert last year when they were here   oh thats when thats when they took toured how about um pink floyd   sure   yeah i like   the   okay so so then we got we got some of the same things because   okay well i just didnt know that much about music and i wasnt sure what kind of music you know   no its very hard because see   well   i mean in 
  the whole spectrum   id rather listen you know t   what   i listen to heavy metal or or classic rock   what what kind of heavy metal are we talking about what   were talking about what they th they call   hard rock   okay like give me some examples   like for example lets see   uh bad company 
  what   like   oh well bad cam   companys not bad thats not   well   well theyre like for example ac dc   yeah ac dc   yes   why have you heard of them   okay 
  and stuff like that thats   thats   thats not really hard rock   well   okay   i guess i didnt really consider that heavy metal   i mean   i i think when you say heavy metal im   im thinking about like cinderella   you know 
  okay   well cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal   well see i dont really care for cinderella   but i like   ac dcs okay   but see for example they have   see what   what other bands consider it like really hard rock   its like brash metal   which all they do is they have like this guitar 
  and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low   yeah   no i dont really care for that   too much i guess   and   what happens is   ah everybody gets like   totally into the music   and then they start dancing around   and they just 
  bump into each other   uhhuh   uhhuh   like   like   they hit each other with their shoulders   uhhuh   and then you knock people down   and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people   is that the kind of music that you like 
  oh okay   no i dont like that music   but thats thats what they do thats thats what some people call like really heavy metal   and see   the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also   oh okay   like   really   like heavy metal   considered 
  like the   words heavy metal and like they always talk about like suicide   and killing people and stuff like that   yeah   and just hard rock has   th they dont talk about that they just talk about like life in general   like queens reich   if you ever heard of them   right   oh sure of course 
  quee   you you talking queen is that what you said   so   okay then well no   i said queens reich but   oh   oh oh oh   okay   but   but oh no you got to like queen also 
  so because   right   well sure because queen was real popular when i was   growing up   yeah especially uh oh god what is it a night at the opera   dont they have a   no lets see   the one that they have the the whole   opera sing in the background   oh 
  um   uh   oh   bo bo bohemian rhapsody   yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up   right right   yep   yeah   because i mean i just love that song   yeah 
  that that was a real   good one   yeah but they had th that that whole record was pretty good   but then they started going downhill like everybody else   well thats true they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that   yeah they theyre still around they got a new a new cd out   but i d i wouldnt buy it   because see what happens is   the oldies   see what i like i like the old rolling stones i dont like the new stuff 
  of the stones   yeah i agree   thats   the new   the older stuff   yeah   is   the   best of it the the new stuffs kind of more like   todays 
  rock and roll which i dont really   care for todays rock and roll too much its   yeah   yeah   well for example i used to like the old phil collins   an old genesis   and   and then what happened was that   phil collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this   right 
  yes   definitely i agree   and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like no jacket required   uhhuh   that was good but it was on its way of going downhill because he said i can make   a lot of money just singing alone   and then he came out with the invisible touch with uh   genesis   and that really   like now i hate phil collins i cant stand him 
  because i look at him and i say   right   you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great   and now youre singing all this stuff that   doesnt matter what you what you sing or what you record its still   going to be a number one hit   and so thats thats what   gets me mad   yeah   that 
  but did   did you go see that new doors movie   no not yet i guess ive been con kind of considering it have you seen it yet   yeah i saw it when it opened   was it really good   was it   yeah   well i   its its uh you know its like   i was watching siskel and ebert 
  you know like those guys that   criticize movies   uhhuh   right   and they both loved the movie   right   they said the musics great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that   and then   one of them said   well everything is great but im gonna give it a thumbs down 
  uhhuh   uhhuh   and they go but why   because its   like the end is like really depressing   and so an but but its like but its like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it   just   picks you up see i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine   uh   oh 
  okay so you   didnt really grow up with that kind of music then   so i mean   so for me   no but you learn to   i mean its just   that   like the the sixties musics got a lot to say   right   well thats 
  i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too   you know i was like   well no now   seventies music i mean im   like i said   you know i dont like disco ive never liked disco   you know but   hey but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants and   well thats true   thats true 
  but   i i was more um in the late   seven well   i   i shoul like mid to late seventies like between seventy five and and seventy nine was more my era   um   yeah   did did you go to college   well no   im going right now but um no i didnt go then but see i graduated high school in seventy eight 
  oh thats cool   okay   so you know in seventy eight you know rock was really starting to get really   heavy you know and real   um   yeah   yeah   i dont know disco was pretty much   dead by then so   so thats what i mean 
  disco wasnt really my time   yeah   well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in   in   progression   ever in history   so   naw about everything   about music   oh 
  okay   so its like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties   the seventies i dont know what theyre called you know its like   like the   the eighties are called like   the progressive years or the or or you know like   the technology years   uhhuh   because of all the computers and stuff but the seventies got nothing   i mean nobody cared to name it 
  so   thats kind of   funny   youre right i never thought of that the disco years thats what theyre calling them   yeah i know   can you imagine the uh like a big picture of john travolta and saturday night what is it saturday night fever   him just standing there you know   yes   right   thats kind of funny 
  but uh   yeah thats a good example to look for in history   well   from now on were gonna go from the   from nineteen sixty nine when they took the first step   on the moon to nineteen eighties okay   what happened in the middle dont worry   dont worry you dont youre not missing anything   so   thats true 
  well except for vietnam   i mean   you know with   yeah really and thats thats why i guess everybody is   yeah its like   they dont wanna   talk about that so they just dont name it i mean   it was it was i guess it was pretty bad times   yeah   well thats 
  very true   but   so   oh well   lets see yeah okay weve been talking for seven minutes   so   oh good   i havent even been keeping track   okay   all right 
  so um   im gonna leave you alone uh what what are you doing do you have a family   uh yeah   were   kind of i was kind of in the middle of supper but its not a big deal   you know i just left it no its okay because see i didnt see somebody tried to call me last night but i didnt have my number yet i just got it today   okay   oh im sorry   oh okay   and so you know its okay i i 
  told them id be available during this time so   anyway   okay   alrighty   so then uh have fun doing this   it is not that bad byebye   okay thanks   great   bye   hi diana 
  hi   have yall been able to do much as a family   these days   pardon me   have yall been able to do much as a   as a full family these days all of you   oh yes weve um   been um   weve gone other   you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner 
  we take the kids to the park and um   yeah   you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we   you know we   we do everything we can possibly as a family   do you work outside the home   no i dont   yeah i dont either it makes a little bit easier i think that way   yeah   it does an 
  an then uh   you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know hell   hell take them out just   to be with them   so h they can have time with him an   yeah   so you have a break too   right so   and we uh   we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have 
  we try to spend like monday nights   we call it family home evening and   uhhuh   have our kids um   you know have little lessons with them and   you know just see count see how things are going in our family and   you know   teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and   we just do all kinds of fun things like that an   uh we have family thats far away it sounds like you might too 
  yeah we do so they   you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so   yeah   right   and um   and phone calls thats about   about it   yeah   right and uh   you know they 
  we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard an   sit down an   thats wha   yeah thats what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is   excuse me only   fourteen months she   shes really   getting to the age where shes playing and   likes to go places   yeah 
  right   uhhuh   yeah   and   with you know me being at home and   just having the one income   you know you dont have this lot of extra money to   to do a lot of   you know extra things so you   you make more fun than you know 
  you know the kids just think its wonderful just maybe to go get   an ice cream cone or   that   thats right   oh thats a big thrill for them   yeah or um you know   go get a bag of m and ms or something like that they   they think thats a lot of fun so we just we try to spend as much time as we can we   you know our wh our whole weekends are divi are devoted to our children except for   we might go out you know one evening or something but 
  yeah   during the day   you know its all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us an   yeah   thats true   so   yeah   so   have um   have you ever been to the science no its called the science place 
  yes   yes thats what   we ju   we havent lived here too long we went there   couple weeks ago   uhhuh   the kids thought that was wonderful   and uh   oh yeah we   i guess theres science place one and science place two 
  weve only been in   i think its science place two   i is   im not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went   the one we went in had um   the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area   that really see i mean they really seemed to   go wild in there   uhhuh yeah   yeah 
  yeah they had a lot of fun in there and   um   theres uh   theres some petting you know like uh   uh i think its   owens country farms has a free   petting   you know like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff   wheres that   thats on plano road um 
  its like in richardson you go up plano road   its like   a little bit past campbell on plano road   uhhuh   uhhuh   and thats a lot of fun   they have tours going through there and   oh yeah   um   the kids think that was a lot of fun too an 
  oh that does sound like fun its a little bit of a ways   we take you know whenever we   take them to showbiz or they think its wonderful just to go to mcdonalds you know they dont go for the food they go for the   to play around and   oh   thats right   theres another place in mesquite called monkey business   uhhuh   and its a   indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids 
  that sounds fun too   and parents get in free and its like during the week its like five dollars   admission for child all day   and   and you said a about plano and campbell is the   petting   the petting farm yeah   that sounds fun i think maybe well   try to do that   yeah 
  yeah an the one in mesquite is um   scyene exit   uhhuh   and it its uh   the kids just had a wonderful time there they   you know you just pay that admission and then all the   the   the rides are free you know th   of course they have all the little video games and you know those little   quarter rides you know to 
  and stuff like that but   they thought that was a lot of fun you can have birthday parties there an   yeah   i think that was better than like showbiz   pizza   because theres more for them to do   because they can just do   you dont have to have tokens for everything   yeah   yeah 
  right   so they had a lot of fun   that does sound like fun   well ive gotten some good ideas from you   yeah   i we try to do a lot of things as a family and   you know inexpensively as possible so   definitely   yeah   well i think i dont know if weve done five minutes but im sure thatll be 
  yeah thatll be good   yeah   well its good talking to you   be good   was it good talking to you i had a g i really appreciate your suggestions   oh no problem   well   take care   b bye   okay b bye 
  so what do you think uh do you know any people from puerto rico   uh yes i i used to work with a guy from puerto rico when i worked for hewlett packard   oh really   and uh   he was a native and had gone to school there   and got transferred to colorado where i was living   uhhuh   uh and   he had some interesting times getting used to it um   the united states the the language was a little bit different although he did speak english 
  yeah   have you ever been there   it was just some of the   excuse me   have you ever been there   ive never been there my dad   used to work for dupont and they built a chemical plant down there i almost moved there   when i was in high school   really   yeah 
  no ive never been there either ive not known but just a few people from there   uhhuh   one uh there was a girl in   in my flight in in uh air force basic training   actually who was from there   uhhuh   okay   uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month   uhhuh   and uh 
  i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an   island in the sun you know   and uh   oh yeah   it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didnt want to go because   she didnt play golf or tennis   and there wasnt really a job for her there   it always sounds more   oh its   i think i think everything always sounds more glamorous than it really is 
  yeah   ever because i spent five years in europe and everybody goes   oh youre so lucky and im like   well yeah sort of you   know its but   having lived there its not   its not anything like you picture it   uhhuh   yeah   right 
  you know its not its   like   i still have the fantasies about hawaii and all that stuff but   yeah i lived in colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great   and your just like yeah well   sort of right   i go oh it was just a place to live   yeah   i was   but um 
  what do you think about about um   their situation should they should they become a state   i i think the status quo seems to be working i dont think um   from talking to jerry my friend that lived there that they dont seem   um   upset about it or anything and   yeah   i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it   really i i think   im not opposed to it but when its when the time is right it will probably just kind of happen 
  you know   yeah   i dont know fifty one stars on this flag wouldnt look too good   where are they going to put the other one   yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able   to uh be arranged better i dont know   well where are we where are we going to get another state   yeah   i dont know   cut california in half or something 
  or texas no thats not a good idea   but um   i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because theyll build plants down there because they dont have to pay taxes on the stuff   oh yeah   um and they make i guess its no income tax there   or fed no federal income tax   something like that   oh yeah because its just a territory   or   is that what its called a territory 
  yeah   um   yeah i think its a territory   okay   that makes sense   i mean theres uh lots of tiny islands in the south pacific that are territories like that they could make states like guam   or uh   is that a u s territory though   yeah its a u s territory and   its just we own it or 
  that would be kind of bizarre   yeah   thats kind of far   well hawaii is pretty far too   think about it   well thats true   but there is not a whole lot between here and there   yeah   where you   you 
  start dealing with guam its like   you know   flying over all these other places to get there   yeah   its definitely a way out of the way where   where as   my dad was stationed in guam during the   world war two though   uhhuh   yeah 
  where as puerto rico is pretty close by   yeah   which   i dont know   of course you could annex cuba but they wouldnt like that a bit   no i dont think they would   i dont think theyd go for that   yeah   but actually i knew another guy from puerto rico that i went to school with   umhum 
  and he was coming he came to america to   to go to school   and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there   oh yeah do   you think   he was really funny   both of the ones i met have been really funny guys   i dont know if thats uh   if thats true about all puerto ricans or not   ones i met have been pretty pretty funny 
  no i have   no idea   but uh   so you think that   mostly theyre   theyre pretty much satisfied with things the way they are   yeah i dont i didnt hear any major complaints about it um   i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not   say okay youre a state now or youre your own country or whatever   yeah 
  exactly   but um let them decide   really thats why i said you know when it when when their   time is right when theyre ready for it   you know   that it will come about   yeah   yeah   i think that makes the most sense   okay 
  hum   well rick its been good talking to you   okay ha we have we been on for a long enough time   i think so i think its they want like five minutes or something   dont they   okay   yeah this is this is actually the first time ive ive   had someone call me so   oh okay   but uh 
  it went fine   okay   byebye   all right well it was good talking to you becky   byebye   okay i guess were on   yep   central america have you ever lived in central america   i wasnt in central america   but uh talking about 
  latin america i kind of   i consider latin america to include central and south america   and i did live in uh sao paulo brazil for four years   do you do you think that that   we should have given up the panama canal   uh r realistically   i   yes   i dont see the the panama canal that hasnt had a whole lot of   usefulness to us recently since its not 
  not really big enough to uh   accommodate the   the shipping that it once did and uh maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians   run it however i think were certainly justified in uh   our actions dealing with   uh noriega   in this   well   there are those that that that think that that   that the panama canal has some considerable strategic 
  importance particularly for the military   interestingly enough my father was who was in world war two   and as uh as a civil engineer they   they   they offered him a commission as a captain   if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the panama canal he had worked with united fruit company   uhhuh   there and they uh they   in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties   and they in fact used some of the equipment 
  that had been left over   and uh he turned them down it its interesting that that   most people dont realize how small the canal is have you ever been there   no i havent   its its really i i havent been th ive been to been to salvador and   and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess   and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and   and realistically could be   sabotaged quite   quite easily the thing i find interesting though 
  is that   uh is the whole colonial approach and and   and do we do we support the sandinistas or   or do we support uh   you know when they thought uh   they thought that nicaragua   if you gave them a free election they would vote for the   will you uh   d did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in nicaragua   i i have a a little bit i cant say that im i i would be an 
  expert on the on the region but uh   certainly uh   i   it it gets it g there you youve got this this toss up bet or not not so much a toss up but a a dilemma when   when you want a country to have its   its um   own uh   dominion or its free rein over its its own people   and then on the other hand uh   the uh 
  the government in power that   under   what seem what seems to be popular support   uh sandinistas had   to a given extent popular support   um   starts   making overtures to the soviet union and and   into what we consider our sphere   of influence and now were 
  were in this dilemma over   uh united states is   believes in democracy and and selfdetermination where a   but that on the other hand we believe in selfpreservation and   uh agree with   the or   not so much agree with but are   terribly concerned about the   inf soviet influence in in whats considered to be the united states fear   of the world which is not only 
  you we used to see spheres but now were in a situation where the united states is   looks like were it now   well the interesting part about it is that   if   realistically it was economic i dont know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal but there was an option to build it across nicaragua   uh and there were uh   theres a big theres a big lake   umhum   and um   from a technical standpoint it wouldnt have been a lot more difficult 
  to have built it in nicaragua   but the the united states uh had some   and ive forgotten what the political influence was   but there were economic ties then the issue of   of of   if if its in   the economic interest of the united states   uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh   in other words do we make the world a safer democracy   but if theres no economic benefit 
  right   and i think particularly if youre if youre looking at the   at the at the peasant   uh whether hes in   central america regardless of where he is   is his life   is his life better off under communism or   or uh   or   democratic government you look at salvador where the 
  well he doesnt care as long as hes feeding his uh   his family   yeah and and the question is is   does the government make a difference if theyll mostly leave him alone   uh and i think thats the difficulty they   that that we have that uh it it it reality doesnt make uh   doesnt make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh   central american   leaders that   uh 
  a are that are mostly democratic have done some   pretty terrible things so its uh   yeah oh you can look in   i y p if you look at the region and   and on to their detriment they came from uh   this   uh   hundreds of years of spanish control in the in the spaniards   have a   horrible history of 
  corrupt uh government greedy uh   rulers who   uh have been uh   i dont know manipulating manipulating their public for their own their own good i mean if you go back to the kings and   then the the conquistadors coming in and and the who the   incredibly horrible things they did to the   uh   the   native tribes i mean they make uh   they make the things that custer did look like uh 
  like   trivial and uh you get   it its it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and americans   have uh   have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the panama canal we went in and and took it   oh absolutely   and n we set up   and uh we stole it fair and square i think is uh   and i mean ted   teddy roosevelt didnt have the reputation speak softly and carry a big stick for uh for nothing and uh 
  well whats going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the   the region   uh you know at the moment it   the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh   the idea of   of uh   right   whats the   whats americas role there and it it uh   with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but 
  youve still got   uh cuba that exception exerts some influence   ive   the only   the only thing i see about cuba though is   uh after fidel castro dies i dont think therell be communist power anymore   i i cant see communism in that country   carrying on past him   well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in salvador   where there is 
  a significant u under class   excuse me   and that uh   having a a a lot of difficulty   uh   surviving   uh the question is would they   you know   would they be   better off under communism 
  yeah   and i wouldnt dont know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a   can you can a   can a democracy uh afford the   its like the street people that are starting to show up all over the us is that   thats essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them   right   uh   you know communism would feed them all   yeah well 
  i i dont know if maybe communisms the right the right word for it but what we would   thered have to be some kind of   there   there may be a point at which   a at which youve uh   you might want to consider some kind of socialistic   uh   organization or socialistic setup to to deal with the problem   and then be able to gradually transform   back to a democracy 
  well that   yeah if the guys got some incentive   if hes got uh you know i if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas   to uh where hes got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then   democracy of a considerable interest to him   right   right   but cocoa leaves sell real low right now   yes   it seems yeah 
  a as well as some other various things that are growing in   tropical environments   absolutely   absolutely i dont   its gonna be hard to um   weve th y th y   thats thats where youre absolutely right as weve got to do something in that region to encourage   uh or to make   to make him growing   bananas profitable again i mean 
  yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it   right   well not that we could be bought but uh   i got to watch what i say here i never know when the dia maybe uh listening on my phone   right   well of course all everything were saying is being recorded and   yeah uh its tempting its got to be its got be horribly tempting for those   for those   of course   of course 
  because yeah   yeah yeah y its not j   its not just a matter of uh   of   having an   particularly if youre hungry   extra   car or   having a better car this is a matter for them of   of feeding themselves their wife and their family and and 
  y   theres   a certain degree of honor in   being able to feed your family and theres dishonor in not being able to do it a   uh starve to death is not a   not a whole lot of fun either and that   uh and and and   oh no   you know when somebody comes in and offers i think thats one of the real problems particularly when   when the uh religious organizations you know the catholic church has been accused of a lot of things 
  in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people   umhum   and help them protect themselves no not that they   im im not sure the catholic church is is   is p   particularly political but   right   you know if somebodys hun   okay   uh 
  my favorite show is masterpiece theater   and it has been for a long time but   i feel   almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because   ive   never met anybody   who likes it   do you by any chance   you do   oh yes 
  yes   very much   well   wouldnt you know   as a matter of fact i prefer   public television   uhhuh   and uh   i have   particularly enjoy the 
  english comedies   yeah   and the   english mysteries   yeah i watch mystery too um   i is that what youre referring to   okay yeah   that is good   i like uh do you read   yes 
  vociferously   okay well thats the reason why i like both of those programs is because theyre kind of based on books   and the plots are more   yes   uh   challenging   you know   than   the sitcoms   of regular tv 
  well unfortunately   for   us at least here in the united states we the only   access we have to that of course is   public television   yeah   and   i im not a great   television watcher   in in any respect 
  uh but uh   the   watching   what i do watch is uh   usually news and   whatever is on public television uh   any kind of i also uh   am very fond of great performances   in in that regard   uhhuh 
  yeah   me too   but uh   did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf   oh that was a scream   no uh   no uh   no as a matter of fact   uh   turner broadcasting 
  uhhuh   has been   uh   broadcasting   all of the james bond movies   really   uhhuh   every night this week   so   i have concentrated 
  on watching james bond movies   this week   huh   i used to like him too he was my hero in fact i like sean connery to this day   well theyre showing uh live and let die   at this moment   and it is the first   appearance of roger moore   as   007 
  uhhuh   yeah   yeah   so it   it   oh he could never cut it   no   no thats true i was just thinking that today he   well   in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate 
  in   the early movies   whereas uh sean connery   has maintained the   yeah   yeah he does   i how would you ruddy   uh look   uh   but uh 
  uhhuh   yeah   i liked his   accent too   oh yes yes   and he can even be in movies that are not uh   uh   sexually oriented and he still comes off great   well you know he was   uh 
  when was it last year or year before last   he was voted   the   sexiest actor   in movies or something   yes   yeah he had my vote   double   i mean   the man is sixty two years old if 
  i dont   care   but uh otherwise you know we uh   with   you know pbs and so forth and i i particularly enjoy i dont know whether youve   whether you had a chance to watch it on pbs but uh   uhhuh   the series uh   yes minister   uh 
  whats that about   that was about a   the interior minist it was a comedy the interior minister of uh   in england with the permanent secretary and bureaucracy and all that   oh   yes   yes   uhhuh   right   i l ive seen it several times its a scream but 
  i had to go to bed i have to get up and   and work the next morning   i wish theyd put those   thats why i say did you stay up late to watch this red dwarf   it came on after doctor who   on saturday nights   here at least   umhum   umhum   and its just 
  of course i dont you know you really   it was   i dont think they should show   it   on during prime time but   still   yeah   it was funny   yeah i know well i id   i as i said im not much of a television watcher i read 
  as i said and uh quite a bit i   i read about   uhhuh   two or three novels a week   yeah   in addition to all the technical stuff what d what   what do you do what kind of work do you do   im a payroll clerk   just an accounting clerk   at ti 
  no   uh i have a friend who works for ti   and uh   i work for a a tire service   here in im from dallas   oh i see   umhum well the last two people who have called both worked for ti and i just wondered huh   yeah   yeah it could be   tiers 
  uh i think probably are participating more than anybody else but   umhum   i needed the money   this is five bucks here   yeah   really   do you work for ti   i guess yeah i i guess we all can   no no i work for gte   really 
  howd you hear   oh were not even supposed to be talking about   this though are we   in maryland yes   well   that i guess it it   doe   yeah   how did i hear about it   well i work 
  you know theyre   gathering a database for   voice processing   and   thats my field of   of work also   uhhuh   so i   i know the people at ti who are doing this   and i heard about it so i called them and ask if i c 
  could participate   and uh   huh   yeah   you know sent in the forms etcetera and uh so forth   huh   right   we could go back to television shows if you   well   you know 
  speaking of public tv have you   caught any of this series on the bible   yes i have   ive heard that its   really   against the   well i mean that its coming out with   the idea that the bibles not true   well no thats it   you could interpret it that way 
  uh   uhhuh   i think   what theyre trying to say is that there is a great deal of   historical truth   but   the interpretation that   actually got into the um   the writing of the bible itself is probably   uh after the what 
  uh was it the king james version when the committee   uhhuh   uh   did it wr wrote the uh the or   translation   that so much was lost in the translation   uh particularly since most of the tr most of the translations were from greek   yeah   uh well for example   uh 
  in greek there are seven   different words for love   right   okay so   you can have theres one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one ler word for you know l uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing   so in   those tr those types of interpretations   uh   really made a difference   in how 
  one might   interpret the bible now and what it says   so that   you know its it   you know you can look at it as though they are saying its not true but   theres too much historical   uhhuh   fact involved just from the   uh the histories that are   that were developed around that time that are available 
  huh   to deny that   at least   you know the majority of it   is true   so you know   you know it depends on how you look at it   yeah   you can look at it if you know if   if you want to say that 
  its proving that   it isnt true   then you can you very much look at it that way   i guess if youre   looking for that youre   yeah   hey   you could well   you can interpret that   the what 
  the tv show   in the same way you can interpret the bible   well   uh so   but   uh   uhhuh   really   but uh i   as as far as that 
  goes i a we at   we at least agree on   you know on what we enjoy in   that regard   but uh   yeah thats right   i dont know if theres a   there is a time limit on this   so   uh 
  yeah surely weve made it   well it was   nice talking to   you   okay   you too   byebye   i think so too all right   well its been   very pleasant talking to you 
  and have a good evening   good night   yes um   i was wondering whether you were in favor of   statehood independence or the status quo for puerto rico   i was a   resident although very young of the s of what is now the state of alaska   in nineteen fifty nine   when alaska stopped being a territory became a state   uh so i guess i have a left over 
  positive   feeling about the question even though i dont know very much about puerto rico   um   i know that all the things that happened   relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive   uh and i   k have a suspicion that   that i   believe that a   that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of puerto rico 
  one ought either to make it a fullfledged state   or   or let it go   one or the other   what is your situation   well im   i guess   i dont have su such close experience with with   um   an area becoming a state as you do 
  um   my concern is   the economy   because   as i understand it puerto rico has a   very low st   uh   standard of living or at least um   annual average income   um part of this i suppose 
  is justified in i   in that the climate they dont need perhaps the heating and the housing   that some of th   the more northern territories need   however   in that case i guess   i would favor status quo   i have been to puerto rico and and found it very very interesting i did peace corps training there   oh thats very interesting   and so um 
  you know i saw it   also as a young student and and it was   very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in california and so the spanish was no problem   um   it was   it was   you know very lovely and and   the people   seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with   uh 
  a girl from puerto rico and   i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors   uh   your concern on the   economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures   on   on puerto rico or   pressures on the us in terms of aid or   well probably more on   in terms of the us 
  um   you know im im   not quite sure how the us copes   with this sort of thing ive lived abrode   abroad most of my life so   i guess i ive   been very cut off   uh i lived actually in lebanon so   i was very cut off from the   the press as i w 
  you know   and   uh bec was becoming an adult so   i dont know   how the us would cope with it   a   umhum   new state that is so very very poor   umhum   um 
  i guess   you know wed have a lot of aid   if if you consider the inner cities of   like new york and and   how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country   or the whole   um   new state would require such aid   i guess   um 
  were assuming that that puerto rico would be   per capita significantly more poor perhaps than   than say mississippi or   i think so   okay   thats something   th that i guess i have   not much of an image of other than   than   puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently 
  large numbers of   barefoot natives or something uh not in a   pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess   although im aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have   umhum   um   i dont know whether state woul   statehood would improve their economy i dont i dont know that the ve the act of being a state   would would have any impact on   on them 
  uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they dont have now but of course if their economy is weak   that   there is not much of a base   on which to tax   i dont know if they suffer   in a sense of   income loss   as being since they arent a state whether there   are monies that escape them   so to speak because they arent able to tax like a typical state would be 
  how do you feel though about   well i guess its to their advantage to be a territory but   uh   i wonder how   hav having been   in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time   so they didnt have ready negative feelings about being in the s   in the   alaska at the time since th they voted absentee   i 
  i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se feeling of second class citizenry   uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote   the district of columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times   in their not having a senate representative   umhum   yeah th those are good points um   which obviously id never thought about   um   i dont know wh uh   i suppose 
  they also   not being a state   are   probably freer to determine their own   um   ways of life than they would if   if   i   im trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state   versus a territory 
  umhum   perhaps compulsory education   uh i see what you mean so that   um   and taxes   yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh   there   i dont know i i dont even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation   um   frequently the laws in a territory are are 
  in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i   uh and im thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i dont know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico   um   its interesting because i hadnt thought of   them in terms of   the problems relative to uh   economy   uh   i had thought of it more in terms of political uh   realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the us than an independent country 
  umhum   w   well actually i thin one   one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that   might be significant is that   so   theyve recently voted that   spanish is   the official language which i always assumed it was anyway   umhum 
  so if theyve just taken such action   it would seem to indicate to me either   theyre doing it because theyre afraid they   might become a state and want   to declare this before they become a state   or   maybe because   they dont want to become a state   for fear of losing the spanish   or 
  hispanic heritage   uhhuh   thats interesting   well it sounds as though you are in favor of   uh status quo   i   i believe i would probably tend towards that   and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so im ult i guess im ultimately in favor of status quo also   well thats interesting   at this 
  point   leaning towards uh statehood   right   what about if   if   um   they demanded   to have spanish as the official language   as a condition for statehood   i think i would be 
  troubled   i suspect i believe that any of our states   and i i constitutionally i dont think there are any prescriptions abou against that decision   even if uh   louisiana chose to   go with creole or something   um   i dont think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that im   im bothered by any   tendency to resist what i think was one of americas strengths and thats the 
  the the melting pot   uh   i i   umhum   am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but   im troubled by too close a clinging to   to the   the past   and im also realizing that   that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country 
  um   and canada i guess comes to my mind as theyre going through the throes up there   relative to french quebec and whatever   uh that i i think that would be   a   a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that   um   im troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr   it gets in the way of of   of the melting pot aspect 
  umhum   umhum   thats interesting because   although i tend to be   bilingual spanish   based on experience   uh   i was in bilingual education in california   and   i didnt have any problem with my students but i noticed my 
  my brother   wh who was   uh quite a bit younger   was   learning spanish in elementary school and he cant speak a word   hum   and so obviously it didnt work in california   yeah   but im rather in favor of people being bilingual   and id be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language 
  right   right   but im   im   disturbed by a   country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level   oh i see   um   im im concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess   umhum 
  umhum   well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called   o okay well thank you very much   goodbye   byebye   uh well how is it appropriate to be talking about exercise attitudes   wh   um well um my   my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class hes an aerobics instructor   uhhuh 
  and um is   going to be   uh entering north texas   for a kinesiology program there   umhum   and um   the the how i met him was through uh the aerobics class that he used to teach   umhum youre a student   yeah   so 
  im im an avid aerobics   uh   person and   just very   very athletic   enjoying   a you know uh anything dealing with sports   uhhuh   umhum   umhum 
  so and how do you feel about it   um   im i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise   i   i dont feel like i   i   dont   very often do things for the sake of exercise   i   dont feel well unless i 
  am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things   like   um   ive never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time   umhum   but i do lots of outdoor sports and things   bicycling uh   you know   mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person   but its not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain 
  resistance to the idea of   exercising for exercisings sake and perhaps its because somehow that implies to me its not fun or something like   that   umhum   yeah well i ive my thats the way my mother stands on it she feels like   if its something that you have to do you know if you look at it as if you have to do it   then it becomes   it becomes a chore   and and   she doesnt enjoy it when its a chore 
  umhum   umhum   yes yes   so um and i feel that way too as far as   y you know just sitting and doing you know to   the idea of doing fifty situps or something you know to   umhum   umhum   you know a a calc you know calculated down and   and do your calisthenics you know three times a week or 
  but but i do try and um   umhum   umhum   umhum   i   do try and regulate how much exercise i get   a week   yeah   yeah is that why you like aerobics classes because youre not   sort of someone else is doing the counting for you so it makes it less of a chore 
  yeah   and its got   and ive always enjoyed dance   yeah   so it involves   you know i i cant get out to dance all the time   yeah would that we could   and   yeah   and its and its more regulated i mean youre youre using different parts of the body 
  so it it is like dance an and its structured like   umhum   umhum   that   but you have the music and   someone like you said someone else is counting so it makes it easier for me   yeah   umhum   and someone else is telling me okay   you know 
  l lets move this way lets move that way instead of me having to think about it so much   umhum   umhum   right you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself   yeah   yeah   but im like you i also   um   like to participate in uh things like   well we just went to the uh myerson 
  symphony run this   past weekend and and that was a lot of fun and you get to meet   different people and   um   umhum umhum   just get out   you know out and about and its it   its something you can all like our we did it as a family so it was   it was quite a lot of fun   and 
  biking and i i i love to swim so i love it when you know   its   umhum   umhum   umhum   umhum   swimming weather   and uh   hm   well youre talking to someone from california where its 
  often swimming weather   oh i didnt realize that im sorry well im in texas   i i just assumed that i had this is the first call ive done and i didnt realize that they had were going to   uh   reach out to people from all over the   country   so its the its its the the act well its actually its interesting because there are rea real regional differences um   in california theres uh almost an assumption   you wouldnt know that   oh i 
  um   unless youre sort of clearly of an   uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that im im im   im not   uh theres an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness   and and   at least in urban california   and maybe not i dont know about rural california too well   but in urban california its just   you know for all i know aerobics started out here i dont know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up 
  big here   and before that there was the running craze and they california gets   you know tends to be a bit faddish but   the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere   so there must be something to some of them   and uh   umhum   well i think people are are   more enc   people 
  from california seem to be more health motivated all around i mean as far as the diet and everything uh the diet and   uh just   y y your health consciousness and   i mean it just seems like uh a lot of those ideas   generate out of california   not just exercise   but   health health related   umhum   yeah 
  ideas and i i its curious i dont know why dont know if its   do you does california have a   well theres a sense of it being a package i think   there there is a sense of   you know whole   theres a lot of uh you know youll get   organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh   oh the uni uni uni the university of california at berkeley puts out the wellness letter   which is uh   turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter 
  umhum   monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and   and it doesnt deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it its   on   fairly s   solid scientific   ground uh its just   dispensed with these distinctions it says ev all sorts of factors go into health and theres no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together   and uh so its had that orientation for quite sometime   um theres been some progressive medical schools out here 
  umhum   that have taken that approach   and um   now do you think thats because   theyve realized that   for whole health that the you know you have to have that combination or that people are   motivated that way so that theyve incorporated that into their program   do you think the program came first or the   boy   yeah that theres a 
  i i can say theres a correlation but i couldnt say which which caused the other they sort of   dev you know each developed a little bit   and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more   yeah the more money they put into it i can see that   because i knowing from institutes of   learning like that i know that   theyve got to get their money somewhere and somebodys got to be willing to pay for it and believe in it so   yeah   and s   yeah 
  yeah exactly   and part of it is california you know   in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them   um   had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was   um people becoming interested in alternate   practices i dont know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know   which is similar to a stress management practice or   alternates to uh ama approved medicine   um you have 
  you know major um   acupuncture schools and things out here and   and   you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and   before long   umhum   you you get this this whole kind of gestalt this whole package of   of health of health care and options   umhum   and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them 
  the irony is is its people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented   towards   doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in   back of their desks   the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive   fancy tractors as much as anything   but at least traditionally the laborers last thing   pardon me   yeah   or theyre older 
  well dont you think they tend to be older in the rural ar   i i i sometimes think that its almost frantic effort   on the part of the people in the city   i live in a rural area so   you know i see the   oh   like everything else   yeah   yeah the rat race to exercise   its its yeah its its like its frantic to 
  you know to uh achieve something   that   that a person in a rural area   um   almost   you know doesnt   worry about it   to such a degree but   umhum   stays 
  you know more   healthier you know as a fit person   yeah well i   i think so i mean you   youve if you look at   cert if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about   people who were   considered very healthy in china and they dont do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise   and they combine it with a   you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation 
  and   umhum   they seem pretty you know   they dont have the hard body   they dont have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but   they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day you know   and that   thats   yeah   well dont you think a lot of that is diet too 
  yeah   and a lot of that is diet thats true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat   um   for economical reasons not for preference   um   umhum   yeah and as we can see   well im a im a practicing vegetarian so uh ive   read a lot of information   knowing that to be true 
  whats that   yes as am i actually   i as am i   oh are you also   well thats   thats good as far as the cal is that is that um   pretty predominant as far as california do do   yes   it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now   in the urban areas 
  umhum   oh thats wonderful   well most most   mo sort of modern looking restaurants will   yeah   thats great i mean we uh its such a tr its such a trouble here i mean   you just have to eat at home basically   you can   i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in texas and and and uh   it occurred to me 
  well of course in the cities   yeah well in the cities we live close to dallas so   um   which   umhum   y you know you get uh an influx   of a lot of people from all over the country so   umhum   umhum   youre gonna have a lot of 
  more choices but in urban areas its   you know   steak places an and its   not a you know its uh   definitely   it   its its changing to a degree but   yeah   yeah   yeah 
  um   its very frustrating and even even with health food stores and   stores where you can buy natural products or uh   yeah   organic you know materials and foods and things   you dont really have that i mean you would think   umhum   umhum   umhum   i guess were um 
  uh were were   experiencing uh what to me i guess is a surprisingly mild uh winter   uh   weve had a lot more warm weather than usual and we havent had any ice storms   uh usually we have at least one   um   course ive only lived here three years but uh but that   i still in that three years you could always count on at least one ice storm   my husbands been in dallas during an ice storm he said that   he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and 
  completely stopped just slid   to the side of the curb that theyre that bad   lubbock   yeah   yeah   yeah   we get ice storms but not   not quite to that extent its not the thin sheet   you know all across the road ours if it ices over   its thick its with snow its something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with 
  yeah   yeah   uh   i think weve been fortunate that weve missed   any of the real bad weather this year because we went to california instead   but right now   oh   um   were having unusually warm weather its   its almost like theyre try its trying to skip spring and go straight to summer its either 
  yeah   uh thirty degrees   you know one day and ninety the next and and were missing the fifties and sixties in there somewhere   right thats right its its the same way here   how long have you lived in lubbock   well i have been here   permanently or full time since nineteen eighty   and uh   uhhuh   pretty much 
  off and on since seventy four so really quite a while   and ive watched the weather   shift   you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college   and the spring dust storms   were   wow yeah   uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street   dust storms   whoa 
  yeah   that dust yeah   not fun to be in   but i havent seen any like that in probably   five or ten years   huh   so its its changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but   i guess i can live with it   well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven   umhum 
  and uh   we when we lef we   moved from new hampshire   where it was snowing   umhum   and we got here and we just couldnt believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties   and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like eskimos   and uh and then soon after we had this big   ice storm   uh where everything was just covered with like an 
  inch of ice   and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather   thats true   and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in new hampshire you always have that kind of weather   but um   uh   and i just i just assumed that was the way   it was you know you didnt get snow which was nice because you didnt have to shovel it   and but you al you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was   in the three years weve been here theres been one other ice storm 
  um   y the second year   we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didnt have anything like that this year   well now does dallas   get snow or is it usually just the ice storm   it it uh   w it   if you get any snow   its barely enough to hide the brown grass   okay 
  you know   and uh   certainly nothing that you have to   do anything about   um   well that was one reason why i   figured that i could stand lubbock texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up   west coast sunshine green leaves on trees   yeah   came back here and could not realize why id been so depressed through the winter 
  yeah   and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves   and uh   and course when spring and everything came out again   oh   uh it was beautiful   but thats about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets   you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind   sure   right 
  yeah   but   its not six feet of snow and it doesnt stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming   right   well thats the thing uh with us too its uh j we just   you know   in up   in new england you had more winter than you had a s   summer   and uh you could expect a long 
  winter period   uh for instance um   umhum   we cou you cou uh in new england it would still be cold   i mean ice cold snow kind of weather   uh   now in march it ju in march is   is just when things   start   uh approaching the fifty degree mark 
  a course weve already had eighty   degree weather here   and d day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think   yeah   well now when did winter start there you said you had more winter than summer   oh winter would start oh yeah winter would start   uh in september it would start getting cold in september   now was there actually snow on the ground all th that time from september through what march   there could be   yeah there could be a and it came i mean 
  i used to   i used to work in boston which was an hour and a half away   oh goodness   uhhuh   and i would get up at five oclock   in the morning   just to shovel out   driveway   oh   and thats so i could leave by seven 
  and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning   and then id sitting in that car for an hour an a half   and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work   oh my goodness   so   and so now it takes me ten minutes   well now was that expected though i mean employers expected people   to   not necessarily be there on time due to the delays or   oh yeah 
  uh well they not   they didnt expect you to be on time but they did expect you to be there   and y   the schools well you know they also   did a very good job of   of shoveling the the streets   yeah   they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and   and uh they just you know they were   equipped for it 
  whereas here   if you have a bad snow   nobodys prepared to do anything about it you know the   everything stops   yeah   right   right   you know you   y youd you get the first you know the f first ice   uh storm and the place closes up 
  well now do you work at ti   yes uhhuh   i was gonna say thereve been several times when i know they had ice storms down in dallas   uh that we would be up here trying to call   and it wed figure out after about the first hour that   there aint nobody at work   yeah   theres nobody there yeah   yeah i that happens a lot i   i just live ten minutes away and i dont w i dont work in the 
  at the dallas site i work at the spring creek site which is   which is in plano   oh okay   and uh and so i usually i can usually make it in its just a   hop jump and a   uh whatever the expression is im im real close   right   um but uh   yeah id id hate to have to get it go to dall   drive into dallas when the weathers like that 
  hop skip and a jump there you go   well thats good   well are you   uh do you prefer the kind of weather that youre getting in dallas over your years in new hampshire or do you miss the winters or   oh yeah oh yeah well its like i keep telling people you dont have to shovel sunshine   you know its uh its uh   its just great i mean were really spoiled i mean theres a lot of things we miss about new england you know   uh uh where   theres no trees to speak of and the   big 
  you know thick trees we used to have in new england and we used to enjoy it we had a   we had two acres of land   attached to our house course we only had a thousand square   foot house but we had two acres of land   and um   oh my goodness   and so we   that   now we have this   we have a house thats three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre 
  lot you know and uh   and uh   sure   once youre out of the house youre in the street   thats right and uh so we kind of   i its   weve gone from one extreme to the other   and thats   thats been hard to adjust to   but uh the weather we c oh the weathers been wonderful 
  thats good i did go up to new england one time during their fall season when the weather was just   oh   ye yeah   you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasnt freezing the leaves were turning   and now that part   of a winter up there i could truly love   but uh   yeah   yeah   oh i can remember uh walking around you know taking a lunch break 
  uh you know when the airs real brisk and the   the   colors on the trees are just so vivid   um   oh it was just   that   thats something i miss i i keep   im   i get homesick thinking about it you know   uhoh 
  well what about your summers in dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the new england states like it is down there   oh yeah humid very humid in new england i mean you got hundred degree weather i mean i in in like in the boston area   i bostons right on the water   yeah   and uh youd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just o hundred percent   and it was stifling   uh here y in in   dallas in the dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but its not nearly as bad you ge you get a lot of dry days too   well so thats really no big t i tell you what thats funny to hear you talk about that because for me   to come to dallas in the summer 
  is stifling humidity to me because lubbock is so dry   uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here   but there is no humidity and its   is it   is it okay   yeah   okay   you know if theres a breeze blowing its a nice comfortable day and you dont feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you   you take a shower and walk outside and the humiditys so great you know youre sweating to death again   oh 
  yeah   yeah everythings relative i guess   yeah because i grew up on the east coast   yeah   oh   and uh im originally from virginia   and uh and my   memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity   yeah   and compared to the humidity here 
  you know in fact   uh whenever   i think about   mo you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me   is that   sensation of those stifling summers which which i dont experience here   all right   i play volleyball and   softball and   ceramics 
  ceramics sounds interesting uh   i   do computer programming   kind of as a ho on the side and i also   like to uh   do gardening   and also like to workout   i didnt think of working out as a hobby   yeah   or playing with the computer 
  i do both at home   yeah   yeah   well i   i uh   i work with computers at work and then i come home and d and   i have uh   a little lap top at home that i just like to play with   uh weve gotten a little atari computer   uh husband describes it as a 
  a computer with training wheels   uh   yeah   well pottery sounds interesting have you made a lot of uh   a lot of vases and things or   no i i do ceramics i   i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them   what kind of   oh   uh 
  you know you get them   you clean them up   you know get the uh   mold line off   umhum   you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible   uh   then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it   you know its like a big ogen oven   umhum 
  and uh when you pull it out its called bisque   uh it started it off with greenware   when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and thats when you can   paint it   huh   do you have your own kiln or do you do you   no ive uh   y you can rent peoples kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh   pay them theres one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire   all that i wanted 
  oh   oh well that   that doesnt sound like its too expensive a hobby does uh does the uh   clay and and the paints and things are they expensive   the paints and stuff can get expensive   the greenware it depends on what you buy   now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him   and id say the greenware for   you know twenty four pieces i think is what theyre no no   thirty two pieces 
  is a   was co cost me about eight dollars   umhum   well that doesnt sound very expensive to me   no   i liked it i had fun with it   but uh you know uh   im a little shaky when it comes to detail work   so i couldnt get the fine pieces   so you know i had to 
  umhum   get   parts that had big spaces in them   yeah   uh   couldnt do the fine tailed   fine detail on it   hum   but uh you know i made my son his uh   donald duck and you know the disney characters 
  painted them for him in real bright colors   uhhuh   and uh   he enjoyed them   till he was about two and then he uh   had fun throwing them and broke them   hm   oh no   well   a 
  that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and   he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them   well children will tend to do that   yeah   well   i didnt get mad at the kid   i got mad at my husband for giving them to him   oh   well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to   just to 
  have something to do that   that i know isnt going to   thats thats good for me   something to do other than   i workout with that uh   espn   excuse me   the people on espn   uhhuh   i workout with them 
  or try to   occasionally ill record one of the shows thats on in the morning while im at work and ill do them when i get home   yeah   well i dont work   hm   yeah well i i really   so   i do it in the mornings   i enjoy doing that   i havent worked out in quite awhile 
  i play volleyball i guess thats good enough workout   that is that can be a   a   w uh big workout   do you play volleyball a lot   yeah its fun   at once a week   uh s sometimes we play two ni games a night   you know consist of uh   fifteen point game and you play two games 
  and you know the best uh person that wins two games wins   hm   and uh   few times weve had a tie breaker so i played three games   and uh   yeah   then well get a half hour break or so and then ill go and play another   set with somebody else you know   yeah   its fun 
  hm   yeah i i enjoy volleyball im just not very good at it and i end up j   killing my knees   yeah well uh   ive torn mine up   uh   you know uh we play with a church team so were not competitive were just having fun   huh   uhhuh   and uh 
  when i played softball it was with the church team it was just for fun   although the   church team we made it to the nationals   we were ranked fifteenth in the nation   so i you know im proud of that   wow   yeah   but that was a for ano you know i was in another state then   oh   so im not with the same softball team 
  but theyre starting up soon so ill be playing again   yeah   i have several friends that play softball   they play softball in different church leagues   its   around town   its a good way to get out with people and you dont have to uh   uh lets see whats the word   they have fun without doing   the drinking and all that 
  yeah   yeah   and uh   you know you dont hear a lot of   angry words ill you know be nice and uh   you know its   going out to have fun   uhhuh   yeah   because it you know its a its a hobby 
  you do not want to be stressed out after playing   no kidding hobbies are supposed to be enjoyable theyre not supposed to be   difficult   or or theyre not supposed to   make you less relaxed than when you began   umhum   yeah   well   uh get back to compooter co programming of yours   uh 
  uhhuh   ive been uh trying to program some uh   disk or some uh what do you call them   putting some programs into the on the disk   and uh   ill get to about fifteen sixteen lines and id mess up and it just says you have entered a error   in line   and   i dont see how people do that that drives me batty   uhhuh 
  well i i have a   a computer information systems degree from school   and ive been at it awhile   so   you know you just kind of learn the tricks of the trade and   yeah   and move on   the closest i come to uh   having a uh program work on me was the   the atari toot toot 
  and you know that was just a couple lines and you push a button and you hear a train and then the   the the toot toot   hum   the kids like it though they think its a hilarious   yeah   yeah   well i need to run i enjoyed talking to you   uh   all right thank you   byebye 
  sure byebye   well i havent uh ive been working in my own home for   just um   about the last three years bu so i can just wear whatever i want   around the house   but before then i t taught at the university of houston   and um   oh now thats nice   yeah   so i tried to wear things that were 
  comfortable but still tried to look   you know   somewhat business attire   yeah   yes bu it wasnt quite business but to give the   the students um an   made you feel   like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in   jeans or   tattered clothes that i didnt have as 
  good control over the class   right   right   and if i tried to wear   things that were a little bit more businesslike   exactly   well i i work uh im a financial analyst   and uh   uh   umhum 
  in my group   uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie   uh   but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and   we can wear like uh an open collar or   uh   uhhuh   a lot of times in the summer ill try to uh like on a friday ill try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf   oh thats nice   so uh ill try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh 
  um   and that thats okay thats appropriate   well do you um   meet with clients and so you have to dress   a certain way for the clients or   not really its uh its just uh in our small group we uh   we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president   and uh the senior vice president is uh   umhum   is big on business attire 
  and so um   um he sort of funnels that down to uh   to the people that work in his group   so um   i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh   i dont know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere   well i uh i have noticed   with my own children for example that   they will   depending on what theyre wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act 
  and so   that could be the same can be said for   the business office too   right   see i think thats exactly right you know if if youre uh   if youre dressed in a uh a suit and uh   to me it ma   it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself   umhum   umhum 
  and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the   vice president i feel i just have that   l little extra confidence in myself   being dressed that way   well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that   since a lot of the people were my own age or older even   um   that   because i taught english as a second language so i didnt have your average freshman   student 
  and um   so i   oh i see   i had to do something to   just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you dont quite want to be   their equal   exactly   and so for me to dress in uh   in businesslike um clothes my you know   i i preferred slacks because we 
  had to w   park pretty far   away from   oh lord and down in houston itd be so hot yeah   yes and you wouldnt want to have to walk uh you know in high heels its hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large   right   i see   so i preferred   slacks   and um 
  you know   kind of dressy shirts and things but   right   so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and   i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and   that helped with their discipline and   right   i see   didnt make me have um to much trouble and   right 
  right   with   the students   and i think clothing you know i it just uh   it it does   like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways   um if you   like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so y you sort of dress down but if youre going to a uh   umhum   a social type party 
  then you dress up and that   i think it just has a a change on your attitude   well and i i noticed since we moved down here to texas my husband is originally from texas but uh   im not and   that you dont have to have uh   such a wide variety of seasonal   clothes that you do up   north   where you have to   i see 
  im im sure thats true yeah   totally different wardrobe with   different fabrics you know heavier wools and   right   yeah see the winter seasons just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in   in uh   and   in the the heavier   heavier materials   no and you dont um you know if you 
  usually can wear   pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater   right   or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with   exactly   exactly   different shoes you know we always had like um   higher   higher   shoes higher tops on them 
  rather than just um the lower   right   skimm skimmers i think they call them that you would wear daytoday but   and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than   than mens clothing   because uh   men or at least in my situation you can uh   i can wear the same slacks and uh   sports coats   ne nearly all year round 
  umhum   and uh   ladies you know uh uh i dont know if thats marketing or what but they   they definitely have a uh   i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer   thats really true a lot of it is um   the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable   true   you know if you wear um pastels its needs to be warm weather   right 
  and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and   i guess part of that is um   just   the physics of it that   in what   isnt it dark colors attract the sun and   light colors repel repel them so   right   exactly   plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and 
  and uh   i know in our office uh   our secretary gives everyone a h all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think its   uh is it after uh   labor day or something i dont know and   and uh   so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with   uh i think the way we dress   umhum   thats true theres some rule thats like between 
  labor day   uh no   is it labor day or memorial day   im not for sure its that one in september is when you need to quit   uhhuh right and the one thats like in may you can only wear and   and supposedly we dont have an opportunity my husband and i we dont go to a lot of like where you have to wear   yeah   right   a white   dinner jacket or something and so 
  you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those   two   i see right   exactly   exactly   holidays too   thats pretty funny its funny that we have   as a society   go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about   exac a lot more uh thats right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh 
  spending time and effort on   rather than our appearance   umhum   yes   i noticed uh   when we moved to plano that um   the mall here   collin creek mall i dont know where you are but um   right   i live here in plano 
  yeah   oh you do   that   there there is a pretty um   i wouldnt say snobbish   but it its kind of borders on that that   if i depending on what im wearing i get better service   at the mall   i felt since   oh really 
  huh   uh where you know from   where ive lived in houston that   you have to in order to get   yeah   the attention you might need   help   right   you need to   be 
  you cant just come in off the street is what im trying to say   exactly   and i think thats   you know a north dallas type attitude   oh is it   and uh   because i noticed that uh   like even going to church   uh   seems like people really dress up a lot more 
  uh here in north dallas going to church   umhum   and uh   i dont know thats thats   uh   because i i went to school wi at uh   texas tech in lubbock   umhum   and uh church was a a lot more casual   uh rather than uh 
  you know here its like going to a fashion show almost   yes i think i think your right ive noticed that too its just its very different but ive   i think um   its kind of sad when you have to   go in and make dress up to go   somewhere i mean just to the   shop   right to try to keep up with the jones almost   yeah   yeah and you have to be sure that your 
  everything coordinates and   everything   everything is um freshly   pressed and everything   right   you cant just wear your sweats and an old tshirt and   no   you cant just drop in   well i appreciate um the conversation weve had about   clothing i know ive 
  its interesting to hear a mans point of view its usually my husband   right   hes got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes   and they magically   well now that is   that is   so uh   well that is great i appreciate the call   well thank you and you have a good day   okay byebye 
  you too   byebye   all right   um i think the topic was crime in the city   right   i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place   where is that   uh its about thirty miles from sherman   north south east or west   its north 
  of sherman   well you live almost in oklahoma   uh it not too far   yeah thats kind of ironic because i dont live too far from oklahoma either   huh   you know where saint joe is   uh   ive been through there   im about eight miles south of it   okay oh yeah i had been through saint joe 
  but   um   just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad   well you know   ive ive seen those   statistics and everything   and you know what frightens me   is that   you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert   umhum 
  with   high tech weaponry   you know i mean   the iraqis didnt have a lot of hightech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that   oh yeah   sure   and they didnt kill as many people in   in forty five days   and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job   uhhuh 
  as they killed in washington dc   oh i know i know   i know   um   peo i think   nowadays   people just really just murder is nothing to them   you know   well   i formulated a pretty radical theory 
  over   the last ten years i guess   and   ive come to the conclusion   and this is   a pretty scary thought to me even   that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime   rather than put them in prison because prisons proven not to work   just let them go   say okay youre convicted 
  uhhuh   and just let them go   yeah   and if they get convicted again   well just kill them   umhum yeah   because uh   most likely that will happen wont it that   you know   well 
  i think   that   the   best hope   to eliminate   crime   as we know it today   umhum   is to eliminate the criminals from society   uhhuh 
  if someone is known to have been in prison   they cant get a job   no   you know   they cant be accepted into society   yeah   you know if theyre not going to be accepted into society then everybodys going to become sociopathic   umhum   and   you know 
  whos to put the limit on it   i mean i was watching a thing last night up in washington state   if you get convicted of uh   sexual offenses   on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions   uhhuh   and theyre still let out on the street after one or two years   well in washington state if youre a habitual sexual offender   they just dont let you out   hum 
  uh you serve your prison term   and then you go into the mental hospital and if youre pronounced cured   theyll let you go   uhhuh   well   they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now   you know   hum   so youre youre kind of thinking   in other words if you get if you do something the first time 
  thats not real bad you know   hey   people make mistakes   yeah   to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to   face the consequences then uh   well   yeah use that or   you know theres other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the   people they committed the crime against 
  oh   umhum   umhum   you know   at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against   yeah   feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are   are okay you know well they can free them   uhhuh   but uh you know with the tech technology we have today 
  you can put a collar on a guys leg   that will knock him down   if they leave the property   i mean it will just in incapacitate them   uhhuh   and you can   put a collar around a guys leg   that will   prohibit them   from committing any kind of 
  you know prohibitive act   uhhuh   but   you know putting them in prison my god that doesnt work   no apparently not because look how many years theyve been doing that and look   i mean   yeah   well you look at places like turkey   turkey has death penalty for just about everything   umhum 
  uhhuh   i mean if you get   convicted of uh you know   drug trafficking   they just kill you   you get convicted of uh   you know uh   heinous crimes   they just kill you   i mean theres no two ways about it 
  uhhuh   and uh   you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few   you know and you look at our society   almost   everyone out on the street   that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times   three or four times yeah   right i mean you know   that is true i know 
  you know the way to stop that kind of behavior   is   this   two fold   one   you need to make it illegal for   both parents to work while the kids are under seven   i i think thats very important   umhum oh im   i agree very much so on that i 
  yeah   and then   if   a parent has proved to be unfit   for any reason   umhum   take   the kids away from the parents   yeah   because 
  you know we are what we teach   umhum   because thats what our society becomes i mean we have   a   just a bunch of people   comes   yeah   and ive and ive ive lived in that   that   environment 
  for quite a few years   when i was doing construction work   you know and these guys they come to work every morning and theyre stoned to the bone   i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building   and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their   drugs   and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and   pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on monday   umhum   and 
  the kids of these people   sure they just think thats the normal thing to do dont they   are   phenomenally   theyre sociopathic   y   yeah   and i worked in a   first grade uh   classroom 
  for one full semester   umhum   and these kids   were more foul mouthed than ive ever been   i had one kid threaten my life   first grader   in the first grade   threaten my life told me that daddys going to whoop   me to death   oh no 
  you know   and they flipping me the finger and all that   umhum   and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society   or you can die   uhhuh   because you will eventually be killed   and   you know i just im just totally a   aghast 
  at a whats going on   oh i know i know um   i work in school   umhum   you know thats   huhuh but something i do   and i   it really is im like you astonishing   what the younger ages know and they react   to what they see at home 
  you know   if they see violence at home thats what youre going to   get from the kids at   school   you know   it really is   exactly   and thats kind of sad   well you can see it in the work place   you know 
  used to be when you had a   personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it   uhhuh   now   you know people get fired   or   whats even worse   is   they   promote them into a position that they cant handle and let them get fired 
  yeah   or   one thing or the other you look at   another kind of society like   the japanese   you   put   that many people on that small of a space theyve learned to live together   okay its in their culture   umhum 
  and one of the things thats in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to   is the fact that   while japan was   becoming a great   power   financially   the people   that worked for those companies   worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen   teen 
  and   the company   took it upon itself   to find a position for these people   if they werent fit for the job they were hired for they didnt just can them   they made a position for them some where   huh   uhhuh   uh you look at uh frito lay my wife used to work for frito lay   as a 
  typist   you know transcribing stuff into the computer   uhhuh   well   she can type about one hundred and five words per minute   but she dont like it   she she just doesnt like to do that i mean she will   cause   yeah   but 
  you know her   preference is to be in an office situation   where her   job is   um what kind of hobbies do you have   um   i do a lot of crossstitching and painting   when i do have spare time   really i like crossstitch too   oh i love it 
  i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately   i   thats my case also ive got a new born and and theres just no time   uhhuh   have have you been crossstitching long   oh several years my husband is even interested in it now he likes to help me   design   um   you know projects that are a little more customized   oh really 
  mine sort of he looks at the pattern and he says how do you get that   from there to the to the material   not that hard   i really i really enjoy it   but   oh its not   and once uh once you get started on it its just   oh i just l i love it   i do a lot of my own patterns also   umhum 
  yeah   in fact i did one uh bill the cat you know from   glenn county   oh yeah   that uh was   a real good one to do   it was it was tough but uh   yeah   do you have any others or is it just mainly crossstitch   um 
  i do mostly that   um not very   artistic really for like painting and stuff   oh uhhuh   um   but   now i dont know   yeah   uh b   i 
  w im still trying to get all the dmc colors   oh really   yeah ive   got the kits to to put them all in   i dont have them all yet   uh right   yeah uh   got to counting the other day and uh i think i have what was it two hundred and i got to thinking   the money that ive got invested in this   certainly 
  is uh   it uh   yeah   it can add up quick   oh yeah   i just i   i just keep an inventory of what i currently have and then when i start a   a new project i go through and see if i   if i you know just buy the colors that i need   of what im low on 
  umhum   right   i see well now can i   improvise with adding   using another c color instead you know what comes close   umhum   because a lot of them are are similar   yeah   a lot of times you can do that   think the i think the pinks theres like forty two different shades of 
  pink   good   grief   yeah theres theres lots of pinks and and greens   pinks and greens yeah   theres lots of shades of greens   umhum   but the colors are i just love all the different colors   yeah   they had 
  they had quite a few new ones come out last year   that they added to   b but ah you dont have much spare time either   well not lately   i even started a new job and   trying to get   acclimated   there   oh yes and that   does take sometime 
  yes were trying to get acclimated with the uh   with having a baby and   theres just   hes uh seven months old   yeah   how old   oh yeah   and uh just into everything so theres not a spare moment   oh   but i wouldnt trade it for the world ive been trying to do some bibs for him 
  oh yeah   and uh   a and work on his christmas stocking   yeah   we missed it the the last year so hopefully this year hell have one   yeah   well last year he was a little bit young for having one   uh right right   probably wouldnt have   enjoyed it anyway 
  he   oh he liked   right   if it tasted good yeah   uh   you would have but   uh yeah all he liked was the lights this year so   oh yeah   oh well thats neat that uh you like crossstitch also   yeah thats 
  thats   kind of strange   that we got the same call   yeah uh uh   it to whi   oh   oh im sorry go ahead   no thats okay   okay   uh 
  but yeah ive been doing it for probably about ten years or so   oh wow   no i just started about   well five years ago i think   but but it is peaceful i mean it is relaxing to do   once you find the time to do it   umhum   theres   bit off a couple of large projects baby afghans and got one   done and 
  i think the other ones gonna the child is gonna be in high school before i get finished   oh   on that uh   is it one of those uh   afghans that ive seen in the packages or the   the s large squares   embarrassing   well yeah i just i bought the cloth   and the the pattern for it i didnt   um 
  i didnt buy the uh   i didnt buy a kit   oh uhhuh   well ive seen the afghans in the   in the   stores that uh   are designed for crossstitch   uhhuh   its its that cloth   its called anne cloth i think 
  and it has the borders and everything already   oh okay   umhum   yeah   those are pretty   number one turned out just great and the lady said she couldnt believe   that   they know that i had done it in the colors that they had decorated the uh   the nursery and i didnt even know it   oh thats a coincidence 
  sh i gave it to her and she said how did you know those are the colors we used i said   didnt   that was a   good coincidence   just worked out that way   thats great   um   that uh   now ive   got some material to do an afghan but i just never did get around to finishing it 
  umhum   i like those those are pretty   yeah   lilly yeah lilly   she   she said   i said its for its for your daughter to use oh no   she said i know she doesnt get to touch it she hung it on the wall   yes my uh   grandmother uh 
  made us a couple of quilts   for the baby and i was like oh i dont want to mess those up   umhum   yeah   oh there just too nice i mean you dont get many hand made quilts anymore   yeah   oh yeah   um true   well ive enjoyed this   okay 
  uh but uh   well keep up the good um   well keep up the crossstitching   you too   all righty   bye bye   all right thanks   bye bye   so let me tell you a little bit about the weather here   last sunday night 
  we had an ice storm   which   took down   all of our trees   all   the power lines all the phone lines   it was   i   it was incredible it um   it occurred about two thirty 
  at night   or in the morning actually   um for the past six days weve been out   heat without power   um   without a phone   weve basically been living out of suitcases at friends house that happened to have power its really been horrible   where do you live   were um we live in rochester new york   oh 
  so i mean normally you know this time of year its very cold and we have a lot of snow and   and all that and this has just been something weve weve never seen an ice storm like this before   oh   and people that actually were staying home   um   without any heat they were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees   inside the house   without any heat   oh my word   its really been crazy 
  yeah oh well weve had unseasonably warm weather here in texas we   um   uh   last week if it was uh   i believe it was   monday or tuesday we had   had ninety four degrees   are you serious   uhhuh   yep yep 
  do are you someone that likes the heat   um   i grew up in wyoming so i you know we had   i   didnt mind the heat then   umhum   um   the summer time   the summers here get real hot and i have a hard time with those but   i get use to them you just kind of stay indoors 
  umhum   what is it normally like there   this time of year   um   i   this time of year you know sixties and   you know stuff like   that   so   so would it 
  today i think its about sixty five today here something like that   so   today its sixty five   uhhuh   oh thats great you must be feeling like its uh   yeah its   yeah my husbands outside in a short sleeve shirt right now working in the garden and weve planted our garden   and   oh thats so nice   yeah weve been 
  you know weve been working in the yard and   our peach trees blooming so we have very warm weather here right now   compared to what youre having   umhum   yeah compared to what were having   i grew up in the   you know i grew up in wyoming i remember ice storms and   yeah   we get ice storms here   but we havent had one 
  you know in a long time   but   so whats the lowest   that the temperature would ever get there   uh the lowest temperature that it gets here   um   in the winter time   this winter we had um   some temperatures get below zero   umhum 
  and then with the wind chill it got lower but that was   they did oh wow   it was you know it doesnt   you know it was real unusual   so   this past thursday we had winds and   and snow   to the point where if you walked outside and if youre walking against the wind   you almost couldnt move   because the wind w wouldnt let you walk it was so strong 
  it was really   hum   hum are people going to work around there in this   well um on monday   all the businesses were closed   umhum   and then on tuesday i would say about half of the businesses were closed   uhhuh   um   they finally opened up again 
  i   i dont want to even say as normal because nothing was really normal this week   people were   faced with   trees   through their cars you know trees had fallen right on top of their cars   um   uh   other people had had trees go right through there rooftops   uh 
  its just i th as a matter of fact um   governor cuomo   the governor of new york   uhhuh   is   supposedly asking bush now   to declare rochester um   a disasters   area   wow 
  and obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess   uhhuh   but its really you know besides just the inconvenience of it all its its pretty sad because   rochester had some nice parks   and some really   beautiful tree lined streets   and theyre all   just   destroyed   uhhuh 
  they were all torn down um   the ice   i it was really just a crippling   thing for the whole city   uh   you know when we get snow and ice here it just shuts down the city   i can imagine there be   yeah   because nobody knows how to drive in it so   when you get i mean 
  yeah   here they start even   forecast the weather   you know its gonna be an ice storm tomorrow   theyll come   before the   ten clock news theyve already got schools calling in saying theyve canceled   really   yeah they dont even wait around here to see if they canceled it   in the night before 
  and   oh thats funny   weve had them you know say that theyre going to be   get this   real bad ice storm and   umhum   um   its beautiful the next day i mean   the weather here is so unpredictable you know i   i dont even 
  put much stock in the weather reports anymore because theyre hardly ever   oh jeez   yeah   accurate   well i grew up in boston and in boston um we get our share of snow   but it was always very very well cleaned up   uhhuh   uhhuh   they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know   it would 
  then the next morning it would be fine   uhhuh   and in rochester they   i guess they feel   that they get so much snow   that they dont clean it up for just a little bit   uhhuh   so even for three or four inches   youre just driving right on it the streets havent been plowed   oh 
  theres no salt on the ground nothing   they wait til they get a major storm   yeah they get a little bit of i rain here and they suspect its going to freeze and the sand trucks are out   oh really   yeah because we have you know   it gets even in a rainstorm here that roads get so slick   umhum   you know its no not even cold weather but just rain because the roads get so oily   oh   that uh 
  weve had you know twelve car pile ups and stuff on the freeways because   really   oh my gosh   people just they dont slow down for nothing around here   so   umhum   thats crazy   do   you want it off   sure 
  oh uh no im talking to my daughter she wanted her shoe off   oh im s   oh   sorry   i thought you were saying can you hold on   oh okay   no no i was talking my little girl wanted her shoes off   uh   oh i see   well i just came back from getting our new 
  clothes for today   and well   try l we stayed all last week with one set of friends and um   so   uh   they   were having company this weekend so we had to move and   you just feel like youre imposing on people   you know   uhhuh 
  you dont even have power back to your house yet   oh no   theyre averaging um well there estimating that next   by next thursday   everybody should have there power back   my word   the schools were all closed this week and theyre still thinking of closing them on monday   because   for little kids its its still kind of dangerous   on 
  to be on the sidewalks because there might be some live wires   hanging down and   yeah   oh   and   therere a lot of streets that are just closed   um   because you just cant drive on them and   theres too many trees and that sort of   thing 
  but i one thing that was very funny is on monday   um   almost every single store   in rochester   had been sold out of batteries   uh   because people are needing batteries for   portable radios and flashlights and   you need to stock up on batteries then   really 
  and we had uh you know a fr a refrigerator full of food   and a freezer full of food   uhhuh   and thats   all been   just you know its   you cant use it its its just gone bad   destroyed   ruined   so this storm really 
  i   uh   its been incredible   yeah you have to have some food to eat because the grocery stores probably ran out real fast   right   exactly   as a matter of fact we made on to i dont know if you ever watch dan rather   uhhuh   the cbs news   he mentioned um i guess it was monday night or tuesday night 
  he mentioned the state of emergency   and we all felt like finally we made it to the national news   but   uhhuh   i dont know   i would much rather be in the warm   of   sun   oh wow   yeah yeah because its beautiful here today i havent gone outside been too busy 
  working inside   but   umhum   its beautiful here   well throughout all of this i called my inlaws who live in florida   oh   and they just finished putting in a pool   so while i was sitting   freezing in a pay phone outside of our house   um 
  they were sitting by the pool sipping you know   a glass of wine and   uh   oh it was really it was horrible   yeah   its amazing how it can be so different in one part of the country   but   it really is   s because i have family in boston too so   umhum 
  oh you do   oh   i remember the earthquake last year   and i   y you know i guess you didnt you like the earthquake over in san francisco   remember that   and   uhhuh   uhhuh   you know you can hear about it on tv and you just think so 
  but going through its so much different yeah   yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you   uhhuh   yeah because his family my husbands family lives in   but   in um   anaheim california you know just   couple you know miles from disneyland and   umhum   so its amazing how its you know it can be cold here and beautiful there s 
  yeah   thats true   yeah   well western new york is suppose to be use to this kind of weather   but   uhhuh   right now people uh the the crews that are   you could never get use to that kind of weather   no   its true 
  but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to   sixty degrees they feel thats too hot   uhhuh   and they just   they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and   and thats why they live here i guess but   uhhuh   y   you   for the month between 
  basically november   and april   if you dont like the snow and the cold   then you might as well just pack your bags and leave   uhhuh right   because thats all   thats all there is here   thats how it was in wyoming   too you just you know it was always cold then you can   you only had 
  um   two or three months that you could plant a garden   oh yeah   and here we can get three gardens in a year   umhum   we can   replant three times a year and   and get stuff so   that is great   what do you plant this time of year 
  um weve got onions and potatoes and um   broccoli and   what else   all that kinds of stuff like that planted   and what   hi gary   hi   today is uh saturday have you   found spare time to   do any hobbies

  different types of vases   uh ones that stand on the floor and others that you can put on tables   and uh hes been doing a lot of uh lot of decorative type plates lately   umhum   boy they sound nice well i dont think ive ever seen   wooden plates   at any of the craft shows   okay uh well there are   shops around here that have uh   items like that uh 
  not too many   with the style that he uses though   so   umhum   that sounds like a unique item   yeah theyre theyre uh quite unique   and uh its well hes retired so it   its something to do in the spare time   theyve got a lot of time to to work on that now   uhhuh 
  well thats good   keeps them active im sure   well it was good talking to you   uhhuh   okay is that uh thats   alrighty   good luck with your   indoor   gardening there   all right 
  ill talk to you later   umhum byebye   appreciate it thanks   bye   all right   do you have any kids   okay   no   ive got two   and it is hard to find day care for them 
  what um   what do you think needs to be the   criteria set for those   oh   what would you like to see in one   well   i   ive seen the bad side in most of them   uhhuh   i took my son to a day care one time when he was j 
  you know just uh not even three months old   and uh you know it was a desperate thing   and uh   when my husband went to pick him up she he said that the baby had been   crying the whole time he was asleep but you know how they cry in their sleep   yeah   and uh you know this   uh couldnt catch his breath even in his sleep and   that turned me off of day cares   i bet 
  and then when i took uh   ive seen these kids that uh   its a church volleyball they have a day care set up there for   people playing volleyball   and uh   one of the girls was real mean to the kid   uhhuh   hm   and that was you know he shed just   she had treated him like family does 
  you know   and um   yeah   it you know it uh   i know most of the girls up there and   the ones that keeps my kids are real good uh my son doesnt like people too much   yeah   but uh when when we leave there he   uh gives the girl a hug and   tells her ill miss you so you know 
  oh well thats good   so i know they treat him good   yeah   uh   is it   i dont know maybe would you think a   better student to teacher ratio   do they have too many kids   in most day cares for the people they have   yeah 
  yeah   uh   i dont know much about   day cares itself you know   uh   you know this is more of just the nursery for three and under   umhum   and uh theres only theres two people   taking care of about five kids   uh where im 
  where im taking my two   uhhuh   and   but uh in most places yeah they got forty five kids at   best i guess   oh my goodness   you know and maybe about four teachers   and thats a lot of kids   yeah   um 
  we dont   yeah we dont have any but we have you know   plenty of sisters and brothers that   that have them and   uh   im not sure that there is a solution to that   as far as   uh th d there you know everybody has in their mind the kind of day care that they want   but   it seems 
  you know   that theres not really the   perfect one out there   no theres not nobody can take care of your kids better than you   right and thats not even possible anymore i dont think to be able to take care of your own kids   without you know with everybody working these days   well i had to quit my job because of uh   m my two you know uh   day care wise or babysittingwise and stuff   uh 
  because you know my sister was keeping them uh   uh we just lucked out and she uh   met a military man who lived down here   and we came down here for ti   uhhuh   and uh   so i had her baby sitting but she was six months pregnant and it was getting too much for her   so i just quit id rather quit and take care of my own kids than let somebody else raise them   oh yeah   yeah 
  that seems probably the best way to do it   well   you know theyre getting raised right   yeah   yeah   um   i havent really the only   day cares that i have been familiar with are the ones that are local here with the churches   and they seem to   from my experience be the best at 
  what theyre doing   just because of what theyre based on   yeah   yeah if um   i i know one church that uh   there was some problems with but that was just uh   basically a personal problem between the mother and the uh person that was t in charge   oh   but uh   the church uh day care that my kids 
  uh they dont go to a day care you know its uh during sunday school and stuff   uh   the people there are really nice   uhhuh   yeah   yeah i th i think thats thats important   yeah   well   they   i think its one of the important things 
  umhum   if uh   because if they dont like it uh you cant get them that separation thing   and   i need that my kids i need to cut the strings on them theyre not very old but   yeah   how old are they   three and uh four and two   oh   so you know theyre 
  theyre   good kids   you know they do bad things but theyre good kids   umhum   but you know kids   kids do those   yeah   uh   but   i dont like the punishment the day care does you know i dont know exactly what they do but 
  i dont want no one punishing my kids but myself   uhhuh   right   and thats another problem with day care because   youre not there so you dont what theyre doing   right   right   and if   yeah theyre probably i would think needs to be   i dont know if they have any type of uh 
  formal or informal   spontaneous or   routine   drop ins of   agencies   you know people checking up on like they do nursing homes you know   they drop in to see if youre meeting all of the requirements by law and   and i think they need to do that with day cares and just see   whats going on   yeah thats thats thats something that should be brought up with these people 
  so   but im not really sure   i dont know if they do it either to be truthful   yeah i dont either its not until you have kids i guess you worry about those things   well uh   with me i just decided not to face it   and you know in most in   in so many words you know   in one way or the other i just decided not to face that   issue and i just keep them with me 
  yeah   uhhuh   well   i dont know what weve   done to solve any of this   but ive enjoyed talking with you   yeah so have i   oh   and   welcome to texas 
  oh well thanks   and i guess i w weve been on long enough   so you have a good day   all right byebye   thank you   byebye   okay did it click   okay   um well how do you feel about food and cooking   yes 
  oh i love food and i love to cook   i really love to cook   im not a really gourmet cook im just a normal everyday cook   what about you   umhum   well were vegetarians and we just became   vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half   and its a real challenge   to find foods   proper foods to eat 
  and   its a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie   where   your menu is composed of   uh   things that you want to eat   that   arent veg you know that arent dont contain meat products or   dont contain animal products but   maybe arent 
  you know uh   balanced meal   so to speak   so   but we we feel a lot better since weve become vegetarians   dont you do you miss meat at all   i did at first but um not really no not   i i cant imagine eating meat   um the reason i tranged uh   changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons 
  so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating   something you know i i think of it as something alive   you know   so it i cant do it you know f for me its it just   umhum   but i do sometimes   when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly   uh say   steak or something you know that i   i do admit that i 
  you know s wish   you know that i could have that flavor but   but i know what it   i know what it is so i   you know i dont want it   but   so wh   if you have if you have people over   would you fix all vegetables or   you know when you cook for company do you fix just all vegetables 
  yeah you youd be surprised the things i mean you could   like tonight were having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger   and you can its really pretty good i i   the people i serve it to like my sister and family members   well my family members are   vegetarians now basically i mean theyre not theyre not when they go out to eat they   sometimes eat other m you know meats and things but at home we eat   vegetarian meals   and uh   you can ma you know make uh 
  pasta meals and   different things that people are use to eating   that wouldnt offend   you know that they wouldnt be offended that there wasnt a meat there   yeah   you know at the at the table   or even pizzas you can make a pizza thats not   that doesnt have any animal produ animal   you know   you would have animal products 
  it would have cheese but   you know not meat   yes but thats   do you eat cheese do you eat li eggs an   yeah we do eat   i i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is   a person that   eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs   and thats even more difficult its really hard to find   the products and its hard 
  thats even harder to keep yourself from eating   because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or   yeah   you know it really makes a difference   yeah   a eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs its hard to find substitutes for eggs when youre baking and cooking and things   yeah   so although you can i mean theres cookbooks and theres ways to do it   its a lot more expensive too i think   you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan 
  so   but um   but its becoming more that way i think its probably easier now to find things   yeah   it if   well   it really is because   t just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils   and i   you know i wasnt really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store weve been living in bermuda and 
  in bermuda they had a   um   a health food store that   really had a lot of good stuff   and where were living now   is a small town   that really doesnt you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs   and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores   yeah   and they actually had lentils which 
  some stores dont have things like that you know which   i dont think i even know what a lentil is   yeah see that lot of people dont and thats   ive heard ive heard of a lentil   yeah like lentil soup or something people dont and thats such a good source of protein   or like soybeans you know people   think ugh they think its something really   uhhuh   umhum   horrible but 
  theres a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you dont even know where in there   so   um   its its just a matter of   learning   you know   you had to learn i was going to say you have to learn a whole new way to cook   yeah   so but it   oh no way 
  but i bet its really i bet it is healthy because a couple of times last week i went without meat   um i had pasta and salad for two days   just because i just wa you know   oh no particular reason i just didnt feel like eating meat   and uh i   think even after two days i felt different   umhum   yeah   well think of it a   think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest 
  and   you know if youve got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep its still sitting there digesting so   you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat   yeah   you know because it takes longer than some products   some other   foods in your stomach to digest that   meat   yeah   so 
  so when you prepare a meal like say on thanksgiving what do you   um   you prepare a lot of vegetables and theres lots of different casseroles and things so   you just make   you ju   yeah   everything but the turkey   no yeah you just you just well   see at ours uh were living with my family my folks now   so 
  you know they they have the turkey you know they do they ca they you cant stop   you know everyones life   but um   yeah   i think if in our own house we didnt   we would have things   like a casserole things like that that   centered more on   the vegetables   as far as 
  we might have one special   dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey   you know with the main meal   kind of thing   and   and i suppose because its for me ethical   wed just play up the fact that   thanksgivings you know is a time for   everyone to give thanks even turkey you know   yeah 
  even the turkey yeah thats true   so   um   but it its interesting finding different recipes although my mother is the one that cooks   um   which   well do they have special cookbooks out for   for just vegetarian m   meals you know special books that you   yeah yeah 
  lots of them   lots of them   and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact its called sundays at the moosewood restaurant   and   uh its out of new york its a   pretty famous restaurant out of new york and almost every single recipe in there   is um   vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but   a few of those but not anything   but you dont eat fish either do you 
  no we dont eat fish either but   it the majority of the book is   um vegetarian   with no meats   so   or you know of any   any kind of animal   so theres quite a few out there   i have a   i have a hard time with vegetables i dont i when i was a kid i didnt like them very much 
  and i never really learned how to cook them   right i guess   i dont know   umhum   um ill eat a little bit of broccoli and   ill steam it   and i like carrots   just certain things you know but uh im not really good with them and   ill go sometimes and not even fix them   i mean ill have everything else and no vegetable thats strange isnt it 
  yeah its strange because   well it its not strange because i use to be the same way and im   even to this day   you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information   that says   this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs   and when you think about what is   whats the real reason your eating i know   i know its for taste because im boy am i a taste person but   but r the main reason is for fuel 
  you know and and when you read so much information that tells you   that   meats   and different animal products   you know are causing   uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases   you know   like h heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases its like uh   is it really worth it   and 
  the people i i really think in general people   in the united states just dont eat enough vegetables   you know because   you can talk grain all you want as far as   you know cleaning your system out so to speak but   you cant beat vegetables   to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and   and the the the kind that you cant get from a little pill   yeah   because your body doesnt doesnt syn synthesis in the same way that 
  it does when it gets it in raw food   you know   but now if you cook them wrong you can loose the vitamins to   yeah thats true thats true   so you its its all important you know its an all important thing that you   and im terribly overweight   im   obese   probably is the word ive   never used that word on myself before but i am very large 
  and probably if i could give up the meat products and just get on vegetables i would probably look a lot better   i think youd feel probably a lot healthier   um   my a almost everyone in my family is   is obese   yeah i i would say you know th   almost everyone   and uh   exc   except me except myself and you know my husband but um 
  and uh yeah i i   i dont know that my mother and father have seen any improvements   since weve been here as far as them switching to meat but do you think you fill healthier   mom   sh my mother says she feels health   okay   uh the topic is to discuss the uh sources where i receive news   uhhuh   and uh for me thats uh mostly newspaper and radio i almost never watch television   as a matter of course so i dont get news from television except during the war 
  i watched a lot of cnn because it was so good   uhhuh   well why was cnn the on   of course i think   saddam hussein   only allowed cnn to   broadcast it is that not true   um   it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news   coverage 
  yeah   um   i dont know i guess uh   i dont even know why i watch cnn i guess i just wanted more news its one of the few times i wanted   yeah   well i know even if you watched abc nbc or   or the other y i mean   whats the other one   uh cbs   they all were 
  were tapped into cnn   more news than   cbs   were they   uhhuh   thats the only thing they broadcast   an like you i listen to the radio on my job at work   and all this week theyve been having this   uh   yeah 
  uhhuh   a discussion about that is why   uh   why   cnn was   well i listen to a christian radio station   and they were saying that cnn is definitely a world   uh news   service   and 
  uh   umhum   that   was   you cant really be sure   of the quality of what you got   you know   hm   uh   we had 
  some uh   some people from our church went to israel   uh just for a   uh tour sort of thing   umhum   and i was watching on tv they   they broadcast this   terrible riot supposedly that was going on in jerusalem   so we got all fearful   for our people come to find out they came back and said they werent even 
  aware of it   right   and so it really made me question as to what   how do we know   ab you know   uh   if the news were getting is any good   so   yeah i guess the news just focuses on major events that probably   yeah 
  dont affect ninety nine percent of the   people who are right there when the news is being made   right   right   but uh   i c im from california and i can remember being in   uh   in these earthquakes and i mean they were   they were very minor kinds of things   from my point of view and it seemed 
  yeah   you know from anyone elses point of view but theyd get all blown up in the news   uhhuh   uh   well i it   i find it depressing to watch   or   especially tv you know its   uh local news   concentrates on murders and things like that im from dallas 
  umhum   and uh we have a lot of bad stuff it just   really   gets me depressed   even to watch it   umhum   yeah   so then you   wake up one morning and youre in   war with somebody you dont even 
  know about it   right   so   oh what newspaper uh do you read in dallas   uh   we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news but i dont   i dont read newspapers   dont you   how come   huhuh 
  i have find it hard to uh   follow from one page to another   its just something ive never   developed uh   an interest in   huh   and i live in kind of a bad area   where if i have the paper delivered   its stolen before i can   get 
  out and get it   go thats   uh that sounds pretty bad to me i mean who would steal a newspaper   youd be surprised   hm   they just come by and pick them up even if its just for the   tv   you know   uh   selections 
  of the day i dont know   it just wouldnt be there   whenever ive tried it   i see   yeah   so   youre right who would steal a newspaper   but   they do   yeah 
  what part of california are you from   uh from los angeles   but i live in raleigh north carolina right now thats where im speaking to you from   oh   okay   but i grew up in la   i work out here   huh   you work for ti   no i dont i work for north carolina state university 
  huh   but uh i know some people at ti and i have a couple of students who   have graduated and gone to work for them   so im in the computer business   yeah   well i   boy current events is not a good subject for me   well   i dont keep up with it that often   lets see ive

  are you   yeah   i   because every time i got through i went to dallas texas   really   yeah im in north carolina   oh   well youre on the uh   lets see   on the other coast 
  yeah twenty one   yeah shoot man its what midnight almost   what yeah yeah its uh im watching saturday night live here   yeah okay   all right well i guess were supposed to talk what about credit card   w wait wh what did how how did you get to know about the ti thing   oh one of my instructors uh said that they were doing something like this and   wh what are you working on   a a masters in uh information systems   really im doing my masters in in computer science and computer engineering 
  yeah where at   at north carolina state university   hey how do you like it out there   uh i dont because uh   i come from a lot a bigger city than this one and i im in raleigh   and   yeah   raleigh durham yeah   yeah   that area 
  and its really small all all you have is like towns built around universities   like chapel hill   uhhuh   yeah so it its basically a bunch of small towns anyway kind of quaint little towns but they dont have a whole lot there   yeah   where are you at   uh well im in monterey california right now   oh okay   so so i mean its like this this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people and thats about it   yeah 
  two hundred fifty   yeah   okay it its its a lot bigger than monterey is   but were just uh   just south of uh san jose and san francisco   oh okay   and its only a couple of hours away or a hour away to a you know to a large city   so so where do you go do you go to berkeley   no no i go to the   its the naval postgraduate school out here 
  oh okay because um   i was looking at at the doctorate degree in computer science center at berkeley   umhum   and theyre asking like for a um   gpa of like   three point seven or something like that and like theyre looking like for uh gre like   ninety nine percentile and this and that and its like   uhhuh   yeah   well thats what they look for whether or not they get it its hard to say 
  yeah i know thats why thats why i didnt apply i mean it was   like   yeah   for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the   on the verbal part   yeah   its pretty tough   its pretty tough i mean uh lets face it you know   and   you know are you 
  did the   you know as far as i found it   a lot of times with regards to education you know the school only takes you so far you know its what you do   yeah   you know so uh   i dont lose any sleep   sleep over stuff like that   so are are you going to go for your doctorate   probably not see im in the navy   yeah 
  and uh you know unless the navy funds it i probably wont do it until i if i do do it it will be after i get out of the navy   when do you get out   oh probably be another twelve years   oh okay   oh you know i like what im doing right now   but uh but what if they pay for it   what if they pay for   excuse me   if they pay for a phd   yeah 
  nah they wont pay for it   theyve i think they have maybe two people a year go   get their phd   because i know i know a couple of people here that work   for um   the army   um   yeah   they civilians or uh military   i think i think theyre military 
  but i mean the guy is still in   uhhuh   and um   h uh he works over in maryland   uhhuh   umhum   and so hes doing his masters here they gave him like a scholarship   like for a year   and hes doing it in like in a year and a summer   yeah 
  umhum   and so hes getting that   and uh   they said like   they got a lot of benefits and that   thats why you want to join   yeah   umhum   but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money   so you say i go why you still there 
  if you can earn a lot more money once youve get your your you know masters   umhum   they go well they got a lot of benefits   that would go with it so   well a lot of times its you know   a lot of times its not the money that keeps peo that keeps people   yeah   you know they they like what theyre doing they you know they feel good about what theyre doing that type of thing its more   but i mean i mean you   the once you get your masters you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year 
  umhum   and   oh easily im sure   and thats not what theyre paying   no   well it depends on what rank you are of course   yeah yeah i know   well i mean like i say if youre if youre you know if youre at an upper level in the rank category you know youre probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year   yeah   but thats uh 
  yeah those are few and far between though   yeah   its uh its like uh in ibm in ibm you can get certain points   umhum   and uh   everyones a manager   but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money   yeah i imagine its really competitive   you know its like no i i mean ibm is like theres a joke about ibm which says you know its like   uh 
  all all the major companies get into a a boating race right   umhum   and so ibm says well we have t we have to have a team right   and then they come in last and   they have this whole team   you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it   uhhuh   yeah   saying he goes uh   the problem was that there were 
  five people saying row row row and one person rowing right   so he goes have you come up with a lution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah   change the rower   you know its like everyones a manager but you know its like only use like one person does the work so   yeah   too many chiefs and not enough indians   yeah   so   yeah oh that can be that that can really slow you down   yeah 
  that well thats the way it works i mean thats thats why theyre having problems i mean everyones a manager and   yeah   i didnt realize that   yeah   i mean its like its like the people   that actually   do the work there   umhum   are uh   very few 
  and then the other people just plan it   you know its like   its like   have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for federal express where the   with   uh the think tank   yeah   push paper around   uhhuh   you know like all these people are just standing s s sitting around just going you know like 
  what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no and then this guy from federal federal express comes along   they go whats that this track   which its going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time   umhum   and so its like the same thing with ibm you know so they have this think tank   and they got to come up with ideas but   see uh the the thing is that ibm is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff   yeah   oh yeah theyve got a theyve got   basically a uh you know a lock on a lot of the market 
  yeah   and a lot of times you figure you know with the support that they provide   you know   people generally go with that because they figure that the you y you probably wont get fired for getting ibm material   wheres if you try something different   and it fails and youre dead   theyll   theyll say yeah why didnt you buy why didnt you try something more mainline   yeah   well 
  ibm doesnt fire anybody   because uh what they do is they   they put you in a different job   no   umhum   which y you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit   uh   i mean thats their policy they never fire anybody unless youre caught   doing something   illegally 
  i illegal or something like that yeah   yeah like if youre stealing something or   doing anything like that   but   they wont let you off   what theyll do is like   uhhuh   suppose you know like youre a manager   so theyll put you into   uhhuh 
  keeping up   the paper you know its like how much paper is going in   umhum   and then you say thats not my job so you quit   so in other words thats the way they force people out   right   thats why they can say you know theres no layoff policy   right   but   it does they dont really say that you know youre youre always going to have great career conditions 
  right   yeah hey thats kind of sad   no but i mean its like its like   they they have like this different policy i dont know my dad works for them but its like   ibm like never   in their commercials they never put down any other company   you know its like   no   they wont say   well theyre the standard right now or as far as that goes you know people think of computers they think of ibm a lot of times and the main 
  yeah because see what happens is they have a good   backup policy and anybody can fix it   and so thats what youre gonna go for   umhum   yeah well you know thats thats a thats a big thing   and and you know its like for example like leading edge have you ever heard of leading edge   yeah   they are out of korea right   what   leading edge dont they 
  th they made like uh small personal computers   yeah   small pcs arent theyre out of korea right   i dont know i i dont know but what they do is   what they did i dont know   is buy all the parts that ibm would throw away   and build an ibm pc with all the parts that ibm would throw away   uhhuh   oh yeah   yeah 
  bec so is it like for example you test a chip   it cant last seven years but it can last five   ibm says lets throw it away   leading edge will say well buy it from you   okay   and so thats i mean theyre still around i think   yeah ive seen well ive seen them around anyway   you know   so thats what thats what they do they buy all all the things that ibm throws away and they   thats why theyre so compatible 
  umhum   because i mean   and by the time you have a computer for five years youre going to throw it away anyway   most people do   or they have to anyway   you know   well i mean theres like   when when you realize   tea one of my teachers got this computer and which you know its like um voice uh synthesis and stuff   umhum 
  and he got that he said you know its like um   i was testing it and it was wonderful   and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it   takes up all your memory   and i want more you know and its like   wow   jesus christ you know its like why do you want more because its like one second   of recording   i mean you put into a wave   and you want to correct the errors in the wave 
  umhum   takes so much i mean its like   of course it does i mean   by the times it transforms into wave by markov model   and you put it in there   and you want to correct those and then you know youre trying to make the the wave smooth so you can approximately   of course its going to take a lot   umhum   imagine imagine what it is for us to make markov models you know its like   jesus christ 
  thats amazing   yeah   well when you get yeah when you get right down to it   the uh the more they can do for you the more uh like i say the more the more memory theyre gonna require   yeah   yeah   yeah both   both in terms in ram as well as uh   you know standard memory or disk mem disk base   yeah 
  well   like they say like nobody can get enough you know its like   so   once you have something and its like   i was watching this program on tv yesterday   in nineteen seventy six nasa came up with three d graphics right   well yeah you find out   more   yeah   uhhuh 
  and they were showing this like three d g   three d graphics view   of like   like those hologram deals   what   no no no no   this is like   this is like video game stuff   okay   but the only thing was that it was 
  just lines   okay like if you   like a hologram   just graphics on a on a   okay   well   what d   do you think in terms of uh   benefits   well personally you know i think 
  you know of course im sure were familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think   that uh   weve probably got one of the best around you know besides   yeah they tend to offer   ad adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh   one of the things that we were   just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so   i dont know if you participate in that or not but   absolutely   isnt it great 
  its just a its just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know   well i have to agree with that   you know i was thinking about   um   importance of   benefits and that kind of thing other than salary   while i was waiting for   uh the system to find a   a respondent   uhhuh 
  uhhuh   and i started   thinking that over the years   that importance has changed and i suspect that thats probably true for everyone   yeah   when i was   much younger it was   uh   less important to consider retirement and less important to consider   medical benefits but as i 
  grow older and my family grows   it   the medical benefits are   more important and the retirement is more important   i had never really thought of it that way but i guess thats true   i guess thats true im still young enough that   that uh the vacations real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh   you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh   celebrated my fifth year at ti the end of last month and uh   kind of started looking through the 
  the book because of that you know now that im a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and   you know when youre when youre you know in your im only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh   its i guess now is the time to think about it so   does ti have a pretty good retirement package do you think   i think they have um   a   one that we need to recognize that were going to have to supplement ourselves   and thats certainly one of the reasons that im sure that theyve   begun the   yeah 
  uh coda plan   its   uhhuh   uhhuh   certainly a a supplemental way   uh   and i suppose if   b   maybe in   in your instance if if youre 
  started with ti in your   early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them until youre sixty five then youll have a very good retirement plan   right   but i   had another career first   and then came to ti a little later   uhhuh   so its   not   uh 
  all by itself it wont be adequate for   for my situation   its not gonna be   build up quite enough yeah   so i have to find a way to supplement that   yeah   well they just   they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that were doing which is probably   the worst investment in the world but ive got money coming out   to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check 
  and its probably not a great investment but if i wasnt doing that   the money wouldnt be being saved anyway you know y i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you dont spend it so   and its   i unders   understand though it   uh   believe me i do that myself   and i   disagree with you i dont think its the worst investment in the world   yeah 
  do you   yeah   do you really not   i i   you know i i debate about whether its really good or not you know   well its   in terms of   guaranteed return on investment   and maybe you dont   start looking for that word guaranteed 
  until later   yeah   yeah   uh   its   shown a history   that uh sure beats anything else   yeah   thats true   thats very true 
  over many many years   we went uh and did a a thing through   ibs which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in in dallas   and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big   you know   proposal profile for you that ev all the things that you need to work on and you need to do   and then one of the things that we talked about with her was   you know the need to save for our sons education we have a two year old you know and and you know we cant start saving for college when hes sixteen you know we have to do that now and   and uh   they have a way that they can figure 
  you know   what you know and hes two now in sixteen years when hes ready to go to college this is how much itll cost you know and its just really scary the thought of how much its going to its   what it costs now is ridiculous what its going to cost sixteen years from now is just   really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fif between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a   oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have   you know money for his college   and thats exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it   you know in that way at least we know that thats taken care of   you know   we 
  we can worry about other things so   i understand that approach thats what   thats   exactly whats happening in my family   yeah   yeah   is it really   yeah   except that   mine are a little bit older and and ive shown them the numbers and said 
  this is whats going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while youre there   you better   make sure that youve got a scholarship   uhhuh   thats right thats right   well thats what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a   a state college or a private college and   and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him   to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college   he can get a scholarship 
  to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just cant do it   you know   so i dont know its its   i dont uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just dont know how anybodys going to do it   i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them   um   i have a   an eleven year old daughter now whos   saying   gee dad 
  i want to be an   allergist   and i said   thats   wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that   oh   goodness   yeah   yeah   exactly exactly 
  and then her   little brothers only two years behind and he says well i dont know i think   that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said thats   great let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that   thats right thats right   well   you know ti you know ti offers some good stuff and then i think theres i mean i think theres some negatives but theres going to be some negatives anywhere   you know no matter where you go i have   you know all this is the first really   large company ive worked for ive always been involved in little small 
  you know ind privately owned   owned firms and so ive never had the   the big benefit package so i really dont know how to compare it   to other big companies you know it   when i came on it was great see because i had never had anything even close to what   what they offered so   ive been real pleased   well thats fantastic and on whole o   i would say that theyre   yeah 
  equal to   uh most of our competitors   think so   uh i can see some   some potential changes   that   probably are   are   would not cost very much   but 
  might uh   make things a little easier   such as offering a   a smorgasbord   umhum   having a larger variety of benefits   but heres the amount   that   that ti is going to pay for it now its up to you   its menu selection so to speak 
  yeah   yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah   right   that sounds really good   i read a thing i dont even remember if it was in the dallas site or the inside one   about uh   companies allowing you and they said that ti was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days   which i thought sounded like a good idea   you know if youve been there   you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but thats really not enough and you want an extra week 
  then you can   purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay im going to want an extra five days this year   and theyll take a set amount out of each paycheck   you know   and theyre deducting it all along so   you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know you youre really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but its coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know   so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and ti said that they were looking into something like that so   well i could certainly   personally stand seeing them go to a   a standardized 
  compensatory time   for overtime   umhum   umhum   and i dont believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that   well   true   true   uh   and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or 
  or   you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one   umhum   uh   a   as a   repayment for every   three to five days that i   work   overtime there 
  they should give me one day   yeah   yeah   yeah   but it should be a standard and   and not left up to   either the   whim or the current   overhead rate   th 
  uh thats running in each department   umhum   well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to   whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and   you know i see a lot of differences   but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesnt get it   you know   but thats and thats that way with a lot of things   you know   there it seems like it depends on what 
  what group you happen to be in what   what youre going to get and what youre not going to get so   well thats for sure   which is the same but but then its probably that way anywhere   you know   thats   oh im sure personalities always come into play   uh   just in   this 
  size of organization   umhum   well i am new   to texas so i dont even know what the law is   in the state do you   umhum   well   yes of course we do have capital punishment and weve   you know   done away with our quote fair share number 
  oh thats right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper   yes   um   you know different things is it restricted to certain   crimes or just   yes its certain crimes uh   capital crimes murder of course uh   rape   this sort of thing   umhum 
  hum   well   and it seems to be a   disproportionate number of blacks   you know   get into the system   yes i know the one thing that   i think is really sad about it   as i recall from the articles that ive read is that   if 
  if people who have been there   are going to be   killed   um   theres people that come to the prisons and   and umhum theyre very violent and they want i mean theyre anxious for someone to be killed and   i just   i cant see that   umhum   yes 
  th   that happens on occasion it sure does   maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know   has affected you personally you know i dont know or a person personally   uhhuh   no   i think i would be   you know   i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say   you know that 
  i am in certain cases   in favor of the death penalty i dont know that its a big deterrent really   i dont know that it is   i dont know   how wed ever find out you know   really whether it is or not   well there is so many   chances for appeal   that it kee   oh yeah 
  oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars   taxpayer money   yeah its really sad   i dont know i just think um   yeah   somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than   than um expecting   yes   the feeling that it   right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know 
  yes   umhum   is really kind of bad and   yeah   it is its its a tough tough question it really is   hum   i suspect i would be uh   you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were   you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how   personally affected you know you might be by it 
  thats true and there really are   criminals that are   hardcore and   repeat and ne   never have any chance for   oh absolutely   th   thats right   oh i dont know   is it do you feel at all like its a 
  religious issue   not with me personally it is with a lot of people   umhum   its not   not to me personally no   hum   no   i dont know sometimes i feel i mean   i do go to church and things i dont know   how i would feel 
  about it but like you say if it   hit you personally   closer at home you would feel   feel differently   umhum   yes   thats a its a tough tough question it really is   do you think most states have that   or   yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes 
  umhum   hum   but i think the us is one of the few countries that still do   that still does it thats right   yes   theyre only   i was reading something about it the o day i i wanna   think theres only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still   umhum   a lot of them had to 
  have   el elected not to do so   now i dont know what they do in   place of it you know maybe its   life imprisonment or you know something i dont i dont know how they handle it bu   i was surprised to learn that so few countries   have capital punishment   have that   well and it doesnt seem like very many people uh are really i mean theres a lot of people that are on death row but theres not very many people that actually   um 
  do   get killed   oh yeah   yes a lot of them do   get their sentences commuted to   something else   umhum   so   seems like a lot of people live there and then   through appeals because i know they do 
  frequently i mean they cover   cover it pretty heavily on   television and the newspaper   yes   uhhuh   yes   if it   finally gets to that point   right   the first appeal is automatic so 
  that delays it for a few years just   right off the bat   yeah   theres theres a lot of you know last minute   uh   things that happen   cause a person not to have to   go through the whole thing   umhum   so is it uh 
  are we doing lethal injection now   yes uhhuh   thats thats fairly   recent i dont know how recent but fairly recent in the state of texas before that it was uh   death by electrocution   umhum wh which seems so awful   yes it certainly does   so   its a little bit   more humane i guess it is 
  yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you   if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection   yes the other one just seems so terrible   yes   absolutely   hum   its a its a tough question   it really is i guess if i had to say   you know yes or no i would say you know yes i   i would 
  have to   lean toward capital punishment   you know for certain crimes   well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or   its not because we   dont want to   pay for inmates to stay in prison   no i dont think its a monetary thing i think we   hope that it will be   you know 
  umhum   some sort of determent deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that   hum   some of the crimes are just so   brutal and so you know useless   this may s   seem to be the best way out i dont know   yes   easiest way out maybe   no i dont think its a monetary 
  thing   hum   well um i notice that the crime rate was up in the   dallas area   its   yes   especially the murder rate its just gone crazy   and its   kind of been scary to think about it and   yes 
  absolutely   youre hoping there is something that will   cut down on that   yes   i wish i had the answer for that everybody does   you hate to have the dubious honor of being   you know so high in the   yes   its nothing to be proud of   certainly not 
  in statistics   but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasnt had   yes   any crime   so have we   been very very fortunate   and so we dont   its harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way   thats right   absolutely 
  and how they would expect how they would   umhum   hope i mean you   you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and   you wonder why they cant just stop it   absolutely   uhhuh   thats right   so maybe you would   yeah 
  but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone   so would i   i fortunately never been in that circumstance i hope i never am   like like everybody else   no   i know when um   we just   we moved here   um i from the   i 
  got   a summons jury summons just   umhum   like   constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didnt have to go   and its not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury its just that   uhhuh   right   uhhuh   i didnt 
  i hate   having to be in charge of someone elses life   sure   its its a big responsibility it really is   and i would hate to   have to hear any   kind of case   involving a violent crime or anything   yes   so would i 
  that would be really awful   yes   absolutely   well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh   talking about this although it has been difficult but uh   it is its a tough subject it really is   id hate to decide it but   i guess um   guess its important that we decide as a people what   what were going to do 
  right   thats right   anyway well you have a good day   well thank you its nice talking to you   uhhuh bye bye   thank you byebye   okay the question was um   what   what is your opinion of youth uh spending   a year or two in 
  in public service   okay   i think it would be a great idea im not sure about requiring it you know of people because   people are going you know feeling   resentful i dont know but i think it would be a great idea   yeah   seems like theres so many kids that dont have any   since of you know what they want to be or do or   you know they could   learn 
  something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so   umhum   would uh   would you be more in favor of uh   you know like a local   uh   my only experience with it i was in central america for a while and uh in san salvador in el salvador for instance   everybody had what they called there social year   hum   umhum 
  oh really uh   that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for   for uh   high school education   umhum   um   and most of them joined the red cross and it was done internally i just   there was very little external i think   possibly what uh theyre thinking about here more external peace corps   type things where were sending 
  people off shore   yeah   i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to   train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and   hum   but   i dont know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then may maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldnt be able to   really   you know   send children you know to do that 
  yeah   i dont   i dont know how the peace corps works i guess i was of age when the peace corps came in and all that   i didnt know   yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea   did you ever get any information on it like   i sent off for stuff on it but i dont remember   that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um   thats thats what i was wondering about was whether they actually   yeah 
  you actually got paid too while in the peace corps it wasnt much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered   yeah was it   yeah wasnt jimmy carters mama that was in the peace corps or some such thing   yeah i think so yeah   yeah   but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a certain age and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here and take them and   to some other country that had different moral values something like saudi arabia where they couldnt drink   where they couldnt do that   yeah you might end up with a revolution i dont know which end though yeah   really 
  yeah i hadnt thought about that   umhum   yeah   yeah thats thats been interesting though   the kids that   have been over you know coming back right now you know   yeah   you wonder if being exposed to that for a while   what percentage of them would actually   say hey thats not a bad way to do it because from 
  what i understand from some of the guys i know crime   uh   is punishable just almost uh instantly and   public hangings and yeah   in pub yeah   and this sort of thing you know so you dont   have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes   yeah   yeah ive heard that like in china and stuff there is virtually no such thing as rape because if you rape somebody youd be murdered them you know on the you know street so   yeah 
  yeah   well i guess thats uh   the price of freedom i guess is a little   anyway the uh   uh   the the public service thing again i i i   i guess in my own   having had the whole three or four minutes to you know give it a great deal of thought here   uh   yeah 
  i i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of   voluntary but   when you do that then it becomes almost uh   or it can be   yeah   you know there are   people will kind of set up their own little club   yeah thats true   and uh but if   you know if you start 
  the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that   yeah   might not go if it was voluntary but i dont know how theyd enforce it if it was   yeah well if they went awol what are you going to do shoot them   put them in jail   yeah   i dont know send them over to iraq   have a vacation in iraq for a year   yeah   yeah yeah right 
  yeah   i know my dad always talked about uh   he was in uh ccc during uh the depression   and he was uh a rock rib iowa type republican and the only   good thing he could ever say about uh the   yeah   the whole roosevelt administration was uh   civilian conservation corps he   because he was in it he thought that was great   the rest of it was all hog wash but the that was great 
  umhum   yeah   well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if its in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the   umhum   things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might   build jobs for people   you know that were administrating and running and training and   coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too   umhum   yeah 
  i dont know   yeah the only   id like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and   mow the grass and   well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who   who   would determine what these people do   yeah   yeah   you know if uh 
  you know if its run by the   individual state you know like ccc was run by the army and in effect   umhum   and   the only opposition to it really was that it was you know s starting some sort of a military elitist type   you know special corps of uh   cadre of people that sort of thing   and uh when the politics of it get   real confusing   umhum 
  umhum   yeah really there could be um   some   uh scandals involved if you know it wasnt people that were really   fair and   uh   umhum   leaving it you know   in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to   you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had 
  paid somebody to   you know get supported or   yeah   well weve weve gotten to the point where you know if   if if well   it would be open for   if the racial make up of the group was   such and such you know theyd have to do that percentage of work and   what is perceived to be that part of town and   you know all this kind of thing 
  yeah that could be a complicated too couldnt it yeah   oh yeah   suppose uh   well you know they   they had a group of people who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh   cant think of a good example a swimming pool or anything   you know and one   you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to   scream well you didnt build one over here   yeah thats true unfair or something yeah 
  yeah   yeah   yeah   i think uh   oh boy   its one of those things on the surface you know it seems like a great idea its like a   joke i heard once about uh   elephant foot soup you know its easy to do once you find a elephant foot   its its uh its the logistics of the thing that uh   that that gets you going 
  yeah really   yeah well it seems like theres theres a a lot of you dont hear much on the news about young people really   you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but   you know im sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have   good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh   the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show kisha knight pullman was starting a   i guess now shes practically a teenager   yeah   she started some type of um   national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other 
  kids to read and   you know do different service projects like that and trying to get   youth more directed towards   umhum   you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in dallas theres a couple high schools that have wanted to start   like a um   minority you know um i think it was in a hispanic area they wanted to start like a club   for the teenagers instead of they said ever all these gangs kids could join to belong   umhum   but they didnt have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if theres people out there that are 
  yeah   willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy   gosh we ought to use them you know   yeah   if their willing to do it   yeah its its   its just the you know here you to the logistics of the thing again you know who   yeah   whos going to run it you know what   how oh its just so many 
  yeah   yeah well like   like i said at the beginning ive got so many connections with people in central america my daughterinlaw is panamanian you know and they have   situations like like that down there where they   hum   umhum   they have these the social   in some sort of way if you want to go to   school outside the country   and many salvadorians did theyd go to school in cornell iowa of all places 
  huh   and when they came back theyd have to serve this   this this year   and it turned out to be kind of a joke the ones i knew you know always chose the red cross because they didnt do anything   oh i see   and they had all kinds of uh   things they could go into agricultural and   you know really   you know good stuff but   uh unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that red cross 
  yeah   it was so many of them in it that at any particular chance your   chance of having to do something was very s it was very slim and   so   yeah   yeah   well we um we belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints which is like the nickname the mormon church   umhum umhum   and um the there is men and also women women arent   um 
  nearly as frequent and also that have uh elderly couples once their kids have left that can   volunteer to go on a mission   and um theyre all over the world and its it is an incredible logistics i mean they have a training center where they teach them its called the missionary training center in utah and they have to   be taught the language and   umhum   customs and all those kinds of things and then they   um you know go and actually live in that country for the the uh   young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months   okay then thats uh kind of   a private 
  right   organiz you know im im familiar with   my instructor pilot was a   was a mormon he was   because he was a good construction uh you know in instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible   oh   he had a direct connection somewhere uh   yeah yeah right he felt that he really had an in so you know he   things he would do with an airplane but any rate thats off the subject no i havent s i havent seen   yeah 
  yeah but see   they dont get paid for it and um but there is funding that that comes theyre supposedly saving up on their own and the church helps them out some but   you know   umhum   but you know that   it is incredible   y you know   i seen how they were organized in in central and south america and uh yeah its uh   yeah its   very involved 
  well   um   with credit cards is me   i   i try to keep   maybe just one or two i dont   i dont like having credit cards for every store i   i uh   i just dont like them   what are you afraid of with them 
  what am i afraid of   um   i dont know if im really afraid of spending too much i just uh   dont think that i   need them you know   i uh   yes   they are tempting at times but i   i just you know   sometimes i just dont like everybody knowing everything about me you know 
  so   well thats very can be very very true   so   and   there   you know everybody just gives you a credit card just so youll spend money so   well thats the idea they   figure that if they   give you a card at   no 
  charge for a whole year   that you will use it   and   yeah   uhhuh   thats right see they make money off of it whether you use it or not   absolutely well   the other thing of course is the   fact that they hope you   will not 
  pay your   bill at   the end of the month so that you   will be   paying interest   thats right   uhhuh   i use mine   a   great 
  deal   um   for groceries   for everything that i can   and then just write one   check at   the end of the month   for the entire thing   right   uhhuh 
  thats what i do   thats what i do   just a sec   whitney   i will im on the   phone honey   sorry   thats all right sounds like you have a little one there   oh you have   great how old are they 
  i have two little ones yeah   yeah so but   always want some   um   four and two and a half   oh   boy those are   two very active ages   yes uh   yeah im 
  im like you i   i use my only use my credit card   for um   you know when i   you know i just use it whenever i feel like i dont want to write a check and then   but i dont charge anything that i cant payoff   at the end of the month   uhhuh   well uh do you uh do you ever use the atm machines   so 
  no i never do my husband does at   work   just to get cash out but uh   i take the checkbook so i   you know i just if i need cash i just tell him and he gets it out and   i dont even think i know my number   well i   find it   a   great 
  use   from the standpoint that you dont have to continue to   write   checks   in order   to get cash   uhhuh   thats right   see we   he couldnt do without it he but 
  you know   since he can just do it right there at work for nothing   oh that helps   right well   the   the other thing some   people are not aware of is they will use their a   their   credit   card like their visa or their mastercard for 
  cash   yeah   uhhuh   and   when they do   that   they begin paying   interest right   from that   very 
  day   on   youre right and thats kind of   silly   yeah   right   absolutely   because   they   figure 
  that   thats correct   the idea is to use   their money   yeah   your defeating the purpose   yeah   and uh during that whole   month and then   pay it at the end of the 
  month   yeah   yeah   i mean i get   i get at least one or two a week   people   to you know sending me a credit card or calling me on the phone and i just say i dont want it   because i   umhum   right well i think thats the only thing you can do is just 
  say no and mean   no and not   be   tempted   yeah   yeah its like   id like to know where they determine that im such a good credit risk that they can go and   say   you get this much credit line you know   youve already been preapproved 
  well   i   and oh absolutely preapproved thats their favorite word   yes   everybody in the country is preapproved i think   i   think so youre right   well its interesting uh that uh   people have   the 
  generally the same   view of credit cards   no matter where you   go   so   yeah   uhhuh   yeah   and then some people they get   so wrapped up in them that they 
  find   you know   one day they find   wow   i didnt realize i had this much   you know id spent this much money   and then they cant meet the minimum monthly payments on it   that much spent right   well and some people use   one credit card to pay 
  for another credit card   they own and i mean that   does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem   uhhuh   yeah it does because youre   you know   youre   you know youre just   co   costing yourself more money because you 
  if you cant make the monthly   the minimum payment youre paying interest again   so   yeah   thats right   thats right   well its   been enjoyable talking with you   yes its enjoyable   talking with seeing that somebody 
  feels the same way so   well   you you too good luck   byebye   right   well   take good   care   take care of your little ones   uhhuh 
  byebye   okay   ellen   what kind of a car do you think youre going to buy   well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh   i really dont know the answer   um   i would sort of like   to uh   think about 
  something in the way of uh   uh   sort of a sporty car but not any   not   you know a luxury type   sporty one   but um   yeah   something that still has a lots of amenities and   you know 
  gadgets and things   oh you do want a lot of that stuff   yeah   well   yeah i like   i like some of those things they come in really handy   what kind of uh   things are you going to consider you know what   uh   you said something about the 
  about the   well what do you call them   you said amenities   amenities   that they have but what about um   their reputation of the company or the price   um   well of course   i guess uh price is always the big   consideration 
  but   it is for me other people dont seem to have the same problem   yeah   well thats thats a big one in my book   but uh   um   yeah   i have preferences for uh for some   um   makers over others 
  um   and   i   would sort of   like   to   buy american   yeah   but   you know im not 
  so totally hung up on that that   i wouldnt buy something else how about you   well   um the last car we bought was american because of   because of that reason   but have   not been entirely happy with um   several things about the car it doesnt seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be   oh really   because several things 
  minor things sort of   but   still they cost us money   um   that we didnt feel like   we should have had to pay   on a car that   that was that new   umhum   you know we bought the car new and after 
  um   well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch   oh   and   they just said well you know   clutches are disposable and i said   since when   brake pads are disposable   you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable   yeah 
  yeah   yeah i wouldnt have thought so either   yeah   so that was   that was kind of a shock   oh   yeah i   i guess theres a lot to   to think about when youre trying to make that decision   yeah 
  you know the less actually the less you   spend on a car it seems like   luxury cars theyre called luxury cars even though theyre much more expensive like   like uh   um a mercedes   benz   they dont   have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would   definitely not be considered disposable   right 
  you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes   no   but then um   especially not after two years   no   but on the other hand i guess too uh   whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune   really oh i dont know   yeah ive uh worked with a couple of people who have owned   uh 
  various years   uh   mercedes and   umhum   even though they do a lot of the work themselves   then just   buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive   but for them its its sort of a hobby too   to own them   yeah 
  what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying   or   like what things are you looking at   well i havent   rea really gotten that far with it um   ive always sort of liked   general motors   a little bit better than some of the others but uh   umhum   oh 
  i guess i really dont know   how come   ive been kind of   um   i guess the commercials are getting to me the toyota commercials   and i know that a lot of people ive ive known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them   that hardly had any problems at all   yeah   yeah   that 
  i think thats   i think they have a really good um   quality   umhum   my uh   daughter has owned two different ones   and uh   you know weve had some work done on them but its not too bad   and the reason one of the reasons we   um 
  bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a   toyota that he   just really   drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it   umhum   and you knew it had   had been through a whole lot   umhum   and yet   you know it 
  it held up pretty doggone good so   yeah   i thought they would   they seem to be really durable   yeah   so i dont know   im im not ready to buy a new car yet but i dont know if   if the next time im going to try to   to stay with buying something american or if im going to go for a little more   what i would consider to be a longterm investment 
  yeah   well and i guess   you know you always have to think about things like your   gas mileage and stuff like that you know you   oh its easy to get gas mileage in this car   it gets excellent gas mileage   yeah   yeah thats one of the big   throwing cards for   some of the foreign ones 
  umhum   well   we   talked long enough   i think so   okay   well enjoyed it   byebye   all righty   thanks

  oh yeah   oh we did hor i   i did   horseback   riding too   in fact when my children were growing up we always   had   horses   and uh   that was kind of for them but they werent as interested in it as we were you know 
  so uh   that was   a real   id   say probably   for   maybe fifteen years   we   dabbled in that you know we always   had horses around 
  and i really enjoyed   that   oh thats great sound like you   and i was   disappointed when i went to texas i didnt see that many of   them   yes   horses   yeah you really dont   yeah th 
  theres a   you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete   uh   i know   i know its   true   theres buildings and concrete and a lot of people and thats about it down here and   its uh   yeah but uh   thats great 
  well sound like you have a lot of nice hobbies there   uhhuh   yeah you too   you   too   well great   well look   uh   i know its probably late for you   uh 
  enjoyed speaking with you   have a good weekend   byebye   okay   me too   okay   bye now   okay i dont know which end do we   push but okay   okay 
  well um   lets see i   i think uh   theres a lot of people that dont   vote because   they dont really   think their   their uh   opinion is going to be heard   and 
  you know theres such a   small voice and   such a huge number of people in the united states and   that   you know their vo   votes not going to make that much difference   and whether you vote for one person or the other person   the issues is what   you know what you believe in   and 
  that person   is going to have a lot of   uh   since theres so many issues this one person   can believe a lot of different ways on   all of them   so   right   itd be really difficult to   have that one pers 
  perfect person that believed exactly what you believed   yeah   thats true   you know a lot of people uh   uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the   the polly   uh   the party type   followers the guys that uh   you know follow the party lines 
  you know and   they   you know just go in and   if theyre republican they vo r vote republican every year you know and uh   the people that are independent   hum   yeah   you know are the ones that dont uh   dont really   uh show up every year because they 
  cant seem to   to decide   which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate   right   yeah thats good   yeah   yeah i always thought it was back when anderson was running   i was hoping that things would change and hed actually get elected and   party politics would start going down the tubes but   that 
  didnt work   yeah   yeah theres uh a lot of extremes on the parties   too with the   you know the real uh   far side of the democrats   theyre real liberal now to where   probably fifty or a hundred years ago   um   the democrat party being liberal 
  like they are now   you know would never be thought of   it would be the other way that the republicans were real   liberal minded   as far as   like uh   moral standings and   those kinds of things   umhum   but 
  yeah   yeah thats uh   and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the   the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they   each think that uh if more people vote   theyll get more votes   umhum   im always amazed at that that each candidate   thinks its going to be the people that come out that will vote for him   you know 
  yeah   yeah   thats thats true i think in   uh   the texas governor   election   i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than   for somebody   this time   yeah well that uh 
  thats so i i know that theres certain issues that can really motivate people   because we live in a   pr   pr   predominately catholic type area   oh really   and when things start   uh   when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all   inspir 
  inspired   you know   and uh   right   still on the other hand were also uh   this particular community is a catholic community but uh   uh down in dc where   where things are a little bit different uh   umhum   you know its 
  its womens rights and the   a and that sort of movement   and so its uh quite   the opposite so   elections start getting very uh   the   elections where they have that   topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones   yeah   thats true 
  and uh   but uh   yeah thats true that   the   different   places in america that uh   you know different issues would   be a lot more important   than   say in another place 
  yeah   i can understand why   why some of the   the rural areas the voter turnout isnt as much because   it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in dc are like controlling things for the   the midwest and uh   it doesnt matter who they put in office theyre going to fall subject to uh   umhum   the pressure that lobbyists can   put 
  right   yeah and   its uh   well   real true that uh   y   you know theyll say one   thing   to   get elected 
  and then once they do get elected   they dont have the power   or the authority or   the willingness to do those things that they promised   you know beforehand   right   you know maybe it just wasnt possible at all in the first place   you know like the no new taxes thing   you know thats uh   with the 
  economy going the way it is and everything that was   nearly ridiculous   thing to   yeah   even   try to do   yeah   well i dont think hes going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected   right   uh 
  right after the war   uhhuh   that really uh   unfortunately thatll probably even drop   lower   the voters turn down even mo uh turnout even more because   more democrats will think that they dont have a shot so they wont even bother turning out   uh thats true   yeah   theyll just say oh well 
  you know the republicans have this election well   see you in four years   right   yeah   uh   but   yeah i hope some of the local   well thats what they   they   keep saying that it seems like people with 
  i   with   oldfashioned values are the ones that arent   turning out at the   at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh   you know   they they feel like the kids are running the   the country so they   they dont come ou turn out to vote and theyre the ones that uh   you know really know whats going on have the experience and ve seen 
  you know how politicians can   you know screw up or whatever   umhum   but i know my grandmother hasnt voted in years   right thats right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact   and uh   thats true they   i think they look at it as well everybody   the majority of the people think this way when   thats not necessarily true 
  because   you know thats what the media says well the   majority believes this way so   uh they dont even bother   turning out to vote to express their uh   opinions   umhum   so thats thats true   yeah   wonder if theyre going to take into account with this commutiv 
  uh   this   computerized conversation that theres little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking   yeah   do you hear the dogs in the background here   okay theyre   no i cant hear them   the   children next door just opened the fence and   they went off 
  yeah   but anyway   thats   i guess weve uh talked long enough and   that was   sort of interesting what part of the country are you   from   oh yeah   yeah   uh washington dc 
  umhum   are you really   wow   this is   im in from   this is dallas where im at   the outskirts of dallas   oh okay   well i figured with texas instruments theyd probably have a few uh   texans on the line now and then 
  yeah   do   do you work   for ti in any way   no huhuh   wow how did you   how did they get you   or   uh   basically they they went through engineering companies 
  and uh were communications   i w i work in a communications company   oh   oh okay right i work for   ti so   we saw it on the uh the t news one day and   i thought   wow that might be interesting   yeah   yeah 
  we sort of different   yeah   they called me at uh   ten oclock one night that was very strange   well   yeah   i guess they were doing it eastern standard time i was like well i dont know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i   yeah central standard   times what theyre doing it by   yeah 
  yeah   i   still havent figured out what   the zero through   six days which day is which yet   but   i didnt study it that hard so maybe ill figure it out   umhum   but   anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and 
  that was an interesting topic   okay   yeah   okay well if youre ever in uh   dc can look up wayne sherman youll say oh yeah   talked to that guy   okay   okay   im   im kyle hunt 
  too if you ever come to   to   dallas area   well we live right by the airport   oh   okay   yeah yeah   yeah so do we   oh okay   yeah right next to dulles 
  all right   well ill   talk to you later   byebye   yeah   okay   bye   here goes sharon   okay   well 
  what do you think about nolan   ryan   being the first   baseball   player to earn a million dollars   thats the only   thing i found out tonight   oh you found that out tonight   i hadnt even heard that thats great i think he deserves every penny of it   yeah 
  yeah   but there are   some others out there that i dont believe   deserve the money theyre getting   well isnt it funny how baseballs getting less   than like football players would   oh yeah   wonder   because   football 
  and they play a lot   they play a lot longer season too   and a lot more games right   yep   thats exactly right   uhhuh   but i think lets see the teams that were there last year were   see somebody from california i dont even know who won the   pennant last year   beats 
  me   i mean i know   yankees have   won a lot of   games   through the years   yeah   not lately though   we have been talking about this i tried to call   earlier 
  uhhuh   and we had   made a list of all these   uh baseball teams and the cities that   they were from   then i started cleaning and i dont know   where i even   put that   paper i   yeah 
  i was just cleaning and throwing   threw it away   oh gosh   lets see   the teams that   i think the as were in it last year   the oakland as   and i think it was   i dont think it was an all california   baseball

  every once in a while   i   i like to go on the nights when theres not anybody out there not very many people out there   its a lot more fun when youre not   fighting a   crowd   yeah   i think   its fun i like just looking at the   billboards 
  yeah but sometimes when i   if you go out there during the day you just fry under the   sun   yeah its nice at night   yeah   thats when ive been   it is   and   and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those   pictures that theyre going to put out there 
  well   no   yeah that that huge its suppose to be a huge stadium and its going to have little shopping centers in it and little   like a lake or something running through it   and uh   theyre going to try to make it a real community center out there   and youre going to   be able to   buy your   what was no wait 
  of course   what was it about the liquor   thats   thats in uh texas   stadium where the football   players play   was that   oh yeah see you   just   and theyre never going to let liquor in there 
  well theyre trying   i know but they try every year and every year they get   thrown out   its so stupid because they let you take it in there but they dont   they dont allow you to sell it dont allow them to sell it there   uhhuh   but uh   that new stadiums going to be real nice and i heard that   theres uh   that 
  you can bid on that stadium   last night on the news i heard   they said you could   you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you   kind of right   its going to its going to go to the highest bidder   oh   well thats the way to do it   so   yeah 
  so that could be your you know fifteen minutes of fame   you hear that thats   my kids turning on their music   let me see   holly   turn it down   oh   i think its the   bartman   the simpsons

  uhhuh   i mean its good because   they they   try new things you know but its like   yeah i would think it   theyll try something and then they   throw it out and   get something else you know and you get tired of that   yeah   thats 
  typical bureaucracy though   thats thats i think its   going to be any where you go its just worse in the bigger cities than it is   in the smaller ones i dont know sometimes the smaller ones are just   as bad   yeah   well but they cant be though they dont have as much   money   yeah   but the politics 
  the politics gets worse in the small towns   sometimes   most the   time   oh man   but   in dallas you dont even know whos   in in administration theres so many of them   you dont even know who to payoff huh   i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you dont know what 
  theyre there for   you know   when theyre coming   how long theyre going to   be   yeah   oh how funny   you know its just   them there they are and   theyre 
  writing   the whole time   no communication whatsoever   no   i had them walk out of my class and not   say their name   anything   and i   finally   got to where i go 
  okay   im debbie moore   you know   may i ask   who you are and what   you are in my classroom   for   you know   because you know   you never know 
  where theyre   going   what theyll report or   yeah   i know   and theyll tell you theyve   written something down and you   and you havent   you   and you never see it 
  hope   theyre telling you   no   huhuh   thats got to be frustrating   oh it is   how long have you taught taught dallas schools   uh   this is   my eleventh 
  year   ooh   thats about uh ten too many   no actually its   now my jobs   good   much better than a lot   yeah   uhhuh   because im chapter one 
  and all i do is teach reading all day long   yeah   oh   and its just ten children at a time   well thats   not bad   no   its   good   and youve got a lot of 
  federal money too   but hasnt it changed a lot over the years   teaching   oh yes   yeah   or working in the system   yes   when i first started   teaching   i remember i went up to my 
  job and i said okay i want to see a curriculum guide   you know   so ill know what im suppose to teach and they go   we dont have   one of we dont even know where one is   oh god   and   i go okay i mean you just   you did what you   wanted to do 
  oh   how funny   and now they tell you what to teach and how long and   you know what   day   yeah you dont know which is   you dont know which is worse   what period   yeah   no i know which is worse 
  yeah i guess so   yeah being told what to do is worse   umhum   so how long are we suppose to talk for   well you can talk for ten minutes but   you dont have to   oh you can   yeah and no   if you talk   to ten 
  then they come ov   on and say   oh youve extended your limit   and   please say goodbye within   the next five   seconds   oh i havent ever talked that long   well   you know i hadnt 
  either till last night i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland ohio   we   started   talking about   gangs   you know   oh how   funny   he lives in cleveland   yeah 
  wow   and   everybody else that ive talked to has been right around   here   yeah   but   she was real interesting   huh   and then tonight   this 
  woman called   have you   taken any incoming calls   the yours is my second one   okay so   hers was   the first one i   got   gotten and uh   oh she was telling me all her 
  problems   and it went over   ten minutes   did she did she   did you all not talk about the topic at all   well yeah we   did but the topic was boring i thought   what would you serve   uh   if you were having a 
  dinner party   oh   oh gosh   what was im trying   to remember oh the other the one i talked about the other night was   good it was   um   about movies you know who   what have you seen at the movies lately and   stuff like that 
  oh yeah i could go on and on about   that   me too because we go all the time the guy i was   talking to never goes he was boy it sounds like your really up on this and i   said i   see at least two a week   so   ooh neat   that was real good to talk about that have you seen like   uh silence of the lambs 
  no   youve got to go see that   the last one i saw was   dances of   the   with the wolves of the wolves   yeah we talked about that one too and he   he said he didnt think it should of gotten all those awards he thought it was   too long but   oh i enjoyed it 
  i mean it was just more for my money   i   i did too   yeah i didnt think it was   too long at all   um he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch   huh   the other one you need to go see is   sleeping with the enemy   uhhuh 
  and how old are your kids   one is eight and one is eleven   you probably dont want to take them to see   silence of the lambs   its   its not   its   not too cool for kids   they usually pick their own   i bet they do 
  you know theyve got it all figured out   yeah they want to see all the horror movies   well and ninja   turtles   yeah ninja turtles got to have those   but most of the time really we watch them on   the video   dont you   just   massive 
  rental   oh yeah you bring   thats   well heck thats a lot cheaper then uh   taking them out to the show   going to   i know   especially if you   get them for a couple of nights you dont have to watch them all at one nigh   one time 
  thats what we   do especially when its bad weather man just   yeah   plug it in   of course you have to get there early if you want to get anything   i know   decent   well   its good when you go to   tom thumb 
  though and theyre cheap and nobodys got them yet   unbelievable   thats true   thats   true   we saw um   heroes has always been cowboys tonight   uhhuh   it was okay it was kind of slow and   i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end you know 
  it just   it and i dont know it one of   those movies its not going to be around long itll be a   dollar movie in no time   do you read   not very much   no   no   i dont have   the patience 
  to read   see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night   yeah   oh my mom and dad read   all the time   you saw field of the dreams right   a long time ago   yeah sure did   so i was reading the book   and its called shoeless 
  joe   oh really   it was so   wonderful   and then i was um   i decided well i like this author so i got a uh   book of his short stories   and thats been real   good   whos the whos 
  the author   dont   dont ask me   the ghost   of shoeless joe was the name of the   book   oh   shoeless joe   was it like the movie   yes 
  quite a   quite a bit   but you know in the movie the guy was   black   okay   right   he wasnt in the book   huh   thats one difference   there really wasnt a lot of difference 
  i didnt uh see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie   umhum   thats interesting   so   that was a good movie too   well do you think weve   covered   baseball   i think so   okay well have a good 
  n   okay   ill let you start first okay   okay   we um   im presently living in a house uh first time   uh   we had the house built   and so this is our   our fifth year in it i guess and uh 
  um   it was a really excitement to uh   to go out and select   a house and have one made and   built   and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses   and um   as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in dallas fort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home   and theyre good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart   so 
  i would um   not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in   uh because theyre overpriced   um but theyre a cheap house if you cant afford something good   you know theyre good for that   and   um   you can call it a home because its a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting   uh   the longevity of the house is not uh 
  is not worth it   how about in your case   well in my   case my husband is not a carpenter   but in fact hes in electronics but he knew the only way wed ever have   a new home is   if he would   build it   so it took him about   two and a half years 
  but uh he   built us a house   its uh   we have   thirty two hundred square feet   and its a brick house   and   pricewise   it wasnt   great because he did it all hisself 
  you know so that way he could   we could   kind of control   in   control it   umhum   and um   we live in   kind of a small   town 
  umhum   and i mean its nothing fancy   you know its   its a house   its nice and   its real pretty and were all   comfortable in it   well thats great   thats great thats uh   ive heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh 
  who had a house   built   matter of fact another guys   building one now hes been doing it for three years and the citys a little upset with him but   i understand you save a lot of money off uh   by doing that and uh   oh you   can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else   nothing wrong with that uh   ill vouch for that 
  you know   um   so   but uh of   course   my husband did everything except my brothers   a trim carpenter   and he came in you know and did the inside   for us   and that helped 
  a   and uh yes and uh we had to hire   course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing   you know he did everything else   that was a big savings   well thats great   we have you been in it long   weve been in it six years   oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh   maybe um 
  expand or move onward   n   no we   well   uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we dont   need such a large house   that well sell it but he will not build a second one himself   because he says agewise hell never be able to handle that again   yes yes   i see well 
  first ones always a bear   were having a   an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put   on any lot in any state any coun you know so thats kind of the   um   we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and hes charging about a buck a square foot to design it and   hes r certified and registered so at least we know were its not gonna fall in or something if its built   but uh i have heard   uhhuh   yeah oh 
  that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you dont wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and   and thats kind of the plan i have so um   uh everyone i talk to uh ive   uhhuh   yes   i file in my little book and do other things with it   uh   thats great thats great   but uh   like i said otherwise you know a 
  th   the expense   but you know we could not had one as large   as   we have if   you know we hadnt did it ourself   sure   i can imagine   yeah   i mean its not a eldorado house or anything like that 
  but you know its ours   if your happy with it   thats all that counts   thats right thats right   thats o only uh   you only have to   uh   satisfy yourself and no one else   a   apparently the appraisers 
  likes it because our taxes sure is   high   isnt it it really is   ooh and thats uh thats uh   a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess   because i   im always shocked at about you know what theyve   g have it appraised at i think   oh my goodness   a lot of money i bet 
  well thats great   well   yeah i guess that about does it   okay and it was nice talking to you   okay byebye   nice talking with you too   bye   okay   uh   so youre a woodworker uh 
  well yeah i like to do a little remodeling work and   in older homes and stuff i just   bought a home   two years ago thats about sixty five years old and weve done a little work on it   and uh   about   what do you know about timber framing   pardon me   what do you know about timber framing   timber framing 
  okay well   other than you talking about like post and beam construction   that type   well not very much other than what i read we dont use much of that up here although i understand they do in the southwest quite a bit   right   right   uhhuh   but um   up here we generally use uh   uh frame construction work or wood frame construction with wooden siding and and you know most of your homes down south i guess are brick 
  but here theyre   pretty much wood frame construction on a two by fours and and   uh one by twelve boarding on the outside or sheet   plywood   and then some kind of a   insulation material and covered with clapboards or shingles   thats a typical new england home i guess   yeah   the reason i asked is   because 
  were embarking on a little adventure here   in that were going to   use uh some timber framing techniques   to build a   a truss   for a home   ah   and its a   its a   you know what a mansard roof is 
  sure   like a barn yeah   umhum   and theyre mansard trusses   that dont have any internal bracing   so the whole area is like   a cathedral up   there   for the second floor   oh 
  okay thats unique we do a lot of   truss roofs up here but they are   theyre again theyre   theyre truss construction but   theyre well braced you know cross braced inside   held together by steel cleats and stuff   right   umhum   uh mansard roofs are   are 
  in bond building i guess are   they do a lot of that   i understand by laminating   the series of of   beams of planks together   and   and   with   yeah that   thats 
  done some   where theyre actually create a   a single piece that is the trust   umhum   but uh what i want to do is i want to make   four identical   components   and uh   cut   the joints 
  so that   the   the more pressure you put on it the stronger it   gets   and it involves interleaving and uh   using uh   you know locking wedges   well thats something   sure   sure something like the way youd do uh 
  um bricks around a window around a large window type thing the center the center brick is the key brick which locks everything together thats a pretty neat idea   yeah similar to that yeah   well if i do that   and then cover it with uh two by six tongue and groove   you building are you are y   uhhuh   it will be pretty sturdy because we have to   we   we got what we call santa ana wind down   here 
  it comes up out of mexico at about a hundred miles an hour   okay   where are you located   were at a the cor at the   northwest of denton texas   okay   right on the   red river   yeah okay   i lived in abilene for about ten years 
  yeah well then you know about that wind   oh   yeah a little bit   it gets a little dusty there lubbock blows by there about once a month if i remember   yeah   i worked for the ti plant in abilene and and i sure enjoyed the southwest it was really neat   but uh that thats an interesting concept that is this going to be your your permanent home or   okay   yeah   yeah we 
  we bought this land out here were going to   were going to retire on it   maybe in   twenty five thirty years from now but   you know were   were still fairly young   i saw a log cabin built down there that i was really impressed with and it sounds like its similar to the open construction that youre going to have where   the only thing   enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms   but the rest of the 
  center portion of the cabin which was a huge huge house was all open   and the thing i really liked about it was it had a porch on all four sides of the house   all the way around the house   well were only going to have a   porch on north and south end   uhhuh   and uh   well have so uh   anderson window walls is what   they are 
  yeah   yeah   so the whole wall just opens up it will be all glass   uhhuh   because on the piece of property we have its the second highest   pointed in the county   and we can see   oklahoma to the north   the lights of gainesville to the   east and the lights of wichita falls to the west 
  wow   boy thats quite a distance   and thats a and its   its a   were just right on the southern rim of the red river valley   yeah   yeah   i have a a pretty good idea where it is of course i know wichita falls pretty well   well you know where nocona is   pardon me 
  nocona   yeah   okay thats about as far north as we can see just you know right on the other side of the river there   uhhuh   well thats really interesting   and   boy   its really nice its about an hour drive to work   though   yeah well out out that way it shouldnt be to bad i guess your traffic doesnt get too heavy till you head in toward uh toward dallas a little bit but you should spread out pretty good out there i know 
  we dont have any traffic   yeah out in west texas there was hardly any at all in abilene but   uh well with thats a little different here in new england we sure got   some around boston here and new york ill tell you but   yeah   well i used to live in uh springfield   well actually   chicopee falls   oh   oh okay 
  yeah well i live about   i live just over the line   of south of attleboro massachusetts into rhode island   and its just north of the city of providence   about forty miles from boston but   the traffic on the interstate every day back and forth to work it its its an eye opener   thats unbelievable   but it moves pretty well   so   well boy its sure been nice talking with you and uh 
  uh   hopefully well   have another conversation probably another way down the road good luck with your new home   yeah it will be a lot of fun were digging the foundation by hand   is that right   yeah the first floors going to be underground   okay   and and   and it of course it will be open on the south and north end   sure 
  and east and   well   see we have a little knoll on our property   about   thirty feet tall   and its almost straight up   so well nestle the house right up next to it   uhhuh   you going to take advantage of the uh the ground thermal action and   and 
  and and uh use that for your heat and cooling   right   cooling   we dont have to worry about heat i mean   for   cooling especially yeah   yeah   yeah well your winters get a little cold down there sometimes but   yeah but theyre very short   yeah thats for sure 
  uh well were still in our winter up here right now the temperature is eighteen degrees   well the   temperature tuesday was ninety six   yeah   huh   i can stand that   it was   tough today it was cold in the seventies   yeah   well its been cold up here the mornings have been cold the winds blowing about 
  forty miles an hour right now so its really really cold outside   weve been real fortunate we havent had much snow and stuff so   it went   from thirty eight   to ninety six on tuesday   thats a pretty good   temperature swing   is that right   yeah thats   but thats a little too much though then a lot of folks catch colds and stuff that 
  you know   the   the temperature change is too drastic like that it should come a little more gradual i think   well if   you dont like the weather in texas just wait a minute   yeah   yeah i   i hear you   okay sir   well you have a good day 
  it   yeah yeah thank you much   i will talk to you again   byebye   all righty   okay what do you   feel is contributing most to air pollution   cars   cars you think so   yeah 
  i really do i because   im from california originally   and so i saw   the beginning   i feel i saw the beginning of air pollution in the fifties   and i think   then it was   basically from   from automobiles   i really do 
  uhhuh   and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and now its just terrible   factories dont help   yeah i i would have   figured that some of the factories may be contributing as much   as   as uh   automobiles   but we have so much   traffic 
  now so many cars   you know theyre trying to fix it uh   with all this emission control and everything   but then i still see cars going down the road with all this smoke   pouring out of the back end of them   umhum   umhum   and that infuriates me   i always want   to tell them 
  you know dont you know what youre doing to our air   and i dont understand how they can get their   uh   how they can get their car inspected and get away with that   well if you only have to get your car   in inspected once a year you can just go have it fixed real quick right before the inspection   yeah   and and a lot of   when you   a lot of places when 
  you go get the inspection they just pull it out of the garage and then pull it back in   and they dont really check anything they just make sure the lights work basically   theyve really cracked down up here   yes   uh   really   my neighbor   has a   uh he has a   a fairly new car 
  but   have they   its   an   in the eighties its a   taurus   umhum   and   he went to get his inspected and there was something about the emissions something   that wasnt quite right 
  and they wouldnt pass it and mean theres no smoke or anything comes out of his car its a nice car   and   uh he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet   you know   the emissions and he went to several places   oh gosh   so   so theyre starting to crack down   yeah   thatll help 
  yeah i   i really   less people driving and more peo   you know   more people riding in one car rather than   everybody riding to work by themselves will   help a little bit   and if if everyone   car pooled   that would cut it down in half 
  yes   um   ti is   trying to promote   car pooling   up here   with   buses and and trying to get people to   ride share and stuff like that   uhhuh 
  but   um   i use my car for wor during the day for the job so its really hard for me to do that   uhhuh   yeah   but   well uh   in uh   san antonio   the parking downtown i work downtown and the parking is so dadgum expensive 
  you basically have to car pool to be able to afford to park   it costs seventy five dollars a month   just to   park my car   oh my gosh   so i ride with two other   uh girls   so   that way it will only costs me twenty five dollars a month to park but its just crazy   and its 
  from what i understand i know a girl in washington dc and it costs her a couple of hundred dollars   a month to park her car   oh thats terrible   that   that   make me take the bus   yeah and from what i understand new york city is worse   that it just costs a fortune to own a car in new york city   you dont really need one   in the city 
  and they have such good   um   humum   uh   what transit systems   you know theyve got trains and everything i w   and we really need that   yeah   yeah   uh texas is really lacking 
  in transit and   i think when they   if they would   do that and put in trains and stuff   that that would really help a lot because people   i would much rather   take a bus or a train than use my car   umhum   yeah   uh 
  once   youre in downtown san antonio its   real easy to get around they have   a   they have these   uh   buses that   that look like little street cars   umhum   and they go all around that 
  its just real easy to get around once youre downtown the problem is getting downtown and they have   some   uh park and ride   uh express is where you go to the the bus stop and you get on the bus and it takes you directly downtown   but they dont have enough of them and theyre not   convenient enough   umhum   and there just happens to not be one   convenient to where i live   so 
  if if there were i would ride the bus   yeah   can you really see pollution down there   now   oh   no not really   um   not   but see   you can see it here 
  i mean you can just see it hanging in the air   ive noticed once flying into dfw there was   just a a   brownish orange haze   over the city   it was the ugliest thing i had ever seen   yeah   thats it   its terrible   it is really terrible 
  and in the summer time it seems to be worse because it theres no air to   blow it out   you know its its horrible   yeah   this is a nice time of the year though when its so windy it just seems everything is so fresh   and all the trees are starting to bloom out and everything yeah   yeah   so i just hope its not too late   i hope weve caught all this pollution and stuff   hope 
  theyre   were just not going to wait until its too late to do anything were going to have to live in bubbles   worries me   it worries me   they should have been doing things that their doing now   twenty years ago   you know   to stop it   well   and they really havent 
  so well what do we do should we hang up   yeah i guess so   okay   have we reached ten minutes   i think its five and i think we have   ok   okay   okay   okay   byebye 
  well   it was nice talking to you   byebye   okay   so how do you feel about camping do you do it often   i havent in a while but i do enjoy it when i get to go the last time i went camping was um in san antonio   uhhuh   okay   where   where did you go there 
  texas   and uh   um in a park guadalupe state   park or guadalupe river state park   okay   and then i guess before that the last time i went camping was up on   backpacking up on the continental divide   in colorado   yeah for two weeks it was pretty fun   oh that must have been great 
  yeah   i use to live in colorado and did   did some camping up there   oh really   where would you go camping   yeah   um   well the best place we went was uh   the great sand dunes national monument   uhhuh ive been there 
  yeah i just love that place   ive gone there twice   uhhuh   and uh   its really neat theres all kinds of jeep trails and the   the dunes themselves and   its a lot of fun   i like the place   huh   um 
  i guess   in colorado im trying to think of the place we went   was in pagosa springs   and we went up   kind of in the southwest corner of colorado   okay near mesa verdes   yeah yeah because we went isnt mesa verdes where they have the the cliff dwellings   okay yeah we went by there   and then we went to   on to pagosa springs 
  right   okay   and wh thats thats when we got the packs and and you had to put everything for a week   on your back   and there was no showers no nothing for a week it was pretty interesting   yeah   yeah ive done some of that   yeah   it was quite an experience and this was in the middle of the summer and we woke up one morning and it snowed for about fifteen minutes   yeah 
  but it didnt last   any amount of time   thats great   yeah ive taken about four trips across country   im originally from the east coast   but i uh took four   lets see   twice to california and once to   and twice to wyoming   uhhuh 
  uhhuh   and uh   most recently ive just been camping with in north carolina   uhhuh   and one of the best trips we took in last year we uh   a whole bunch of us   um   packed up all the our gear in sailboats we sailed out to this island   on the north carolina coast   wow 
  and its its a totally deserted island theres no buildings there at all   its not its not really that big its maybe   four or five miles long and a mile across   its like   protected water on the one side and the ocean on the other side   uhhuh   well that sounds like fun   and we sailed out there and camped and it was it was really neat   because no one was there   uhhuh 
  a little bit cold   yeah   its pretty   its kind of cold to   to camp on the   coast   yeah i guess the wind and everything uh   yeah   the wind gets really bad   yeah uh 
  ive never camped on the coast before ive always thought it would be fun   its neat to wake up to go for a walk on the beach   uhhuh   i mean most of time when you go to the   beach youre at this real tourist trap and all these hotels and stuff and this was just like paradise   right   did you get a lot of sand in your sleeping bag and everything though   you   yeah we had   sand pretty much everywhere 
  i can imagine   sounds like that would be a mess   yeah   a lot of sand and   having to haul all your all your stuff there in boats was   was   wasnt   um its more work   than a   backpacking because you had to worry about stuff getting wet 
  yeah   i guess thats true too   yes   yeah it   rained on us on the way home   oh gosh   i remember coming back into the uh port where we left and i had a cooler on my head as my hat and we we wrapped ourselves in garbage bags   oh no   god   we were so cold 
  um   but uh   no one couldnt   the last time i went   ca camping was over uh   thanksgiving we went camping up in the appalachians   uhhuh   oh hold on just a moment   uhhuh   okay 
  im on a cordless phone and every now and then i get interference and i have to switch the channel i can hear something weird in the background   sorry about that   okay   and we went   and um   this place outside of uh   winstonsalem   north carolina and it was really cold   um   camping in in november 
  i guess so   year   i guess it gets pretty cold in that   part of country in november i mean here   its pretty unpredictable it could be cold or it could be really warm in that time of the year so   yeah   well north carolinas fairly warm all yearround it it doesnt get   much lower than the   thirties but were up in the   when you get up in the mountains its a little bit different 
  yeah   and uh   well its been   i guess the last time i went camping was well   probably about two years ago   uhhuh   um ive been wanting to since then i just havent had much of a chance to a   bunch of my friends went   and camped up at   the at a lake in oklahoma 
  once this last summer   uhhuh   and i   cant remember why i couldnt go ye oh i was going to south padre that weekend   okay   that was why   but um   i really i like to camp i just havent had much opportunity to do it lately   yeah   some of the problem is you need a lot of equipment to do it 
  theres a few things that you just kind of have to have or you cant go camping   uhhuh   uhhuh   depending on what   kind of camping your doing like a stove or sleeping bag and a tent and all that   uhhuh   and like for the last couple years ive been borrowing it   whenever i wanted to go   yeah   yeah 
  i guess really the most times ive been camping would i ha   i would have to say it would be colorado and new mexico in that area   yeah well thats   thats   just on a big group trip thing and i didnt have to   come up with much equipment because   a for the group we got all the stuff that we needed   yeah   yeah   but um 
  and that was   boy that was a while back when i did that actually its probably been ten years ago   well   but it was quite i just can remember sleeping in this sleeping bag and waking up in the middle of the night just   freezing cold   i mean i just you couldnt stay warm at night no matter what and i was sleeping on my my down jacket with my pillow and   yeah   sleeping in long johns and freezing but during the day it would get nice enough and then   after that week of being up there i can remember coming back down to our base camp area at   at the lake at pagosa springs 
  yeah   uhhuh   and we all   made a beeline for this pump   because there werent any there were just outhouses   and a pump   and we all went to the pump and we were all washing our hair under the pump   yeah   and it was so cold it must have been like   thirty three degree water that just was 
  all but frozen and   it gave us the worse headaches weve ever had in our lives it was so nice just to at least get clean hair and we all jumped in the lake and everything just to just to rinse off   yeah   yeah   uhhuh   yeah   it was quite an experience ive never gone for a whole week in the wilderness with   with no you know no running water nothing so it was pretty   pretty uh interesting experience   it 
  makes   makes you appreciate uh   i guess the conveniences of modern living   definitely   definitely i mean when you appreciate an outhouse you know youve been roughing it   but anyway   well   five minute well actually weve gone more than five minutes so   yeah   okay 
  anyway it was good talking to you rick   all right   byebye   good talking to you   byebye   hi how are you doing   uh   i couldnt hear you   i said how are you doing   im doing fine im just uh 
  editing a spreadsheet right now im trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work til im ninety five   yeah weve been doing that too   were trying to retire in our fifties   yeah thi   yeah   this is a   a very appropriate   topic for our uh   conversation today because   what im figuring out is that im going to have to put in a lot more money than what im making 
  good luck on that one then   whats that   i said good luck on that one then   well   weve got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our   propertys already paid for   you know the main things that i like about   the   uh   the job benefits 
  uhhuh   would   be the uh   the availability of the health insurance   and the availability of uh   you know being able to transfer   around inside the organization   without having you know when they cut off a system and they dont just can everybody thats working on it   like some companies i know of   you know they give you an opportunity to 
  transfer into uh an on going project   so you work for ti then   you cant say   yep   yep   what   yes you do   well i work for disd and i dont know what youre talking about   when you say um health insurance   but 
  dallas doesnt pay   it pays most of   mine   you know now   after you work i think five years   they begin to pay most of it   but then for the the   family   you know m i   put my 
  kids on my   policy   its like two hundred dollars   umhum   and its gone up   quite a   bit   and they predict   you know of course its going to keep going up   i wish they could go on and pay 
  for   all of our coverage   at some point   and benefits you know id like to see   child care paid   for or or   onsite ch child care sometime   i think that would be an   excellent idea and would make women go to work sometimes if they knew their   kids were 
  being taken care of they could go visit them during the day   well   right   yeah thats uh   thats something i hadnt really thought about since   we dont have children   but i can see how it would be a real   benefit   those that   do 
  well we can   shelter also monies that were going to pay in for child care too   you know go on and pay a lump sum   and as long as you pay that amount youre okay but if you paid in more   than   you actually   used   and the same thing for insurance what you predict youre going to be paying for insurance   as long as you pay   actually pay out that amount of money youre okay but if you pay out 
  less   then you lose that money   hum   i dont like that part   but you dont have to do that option if you dont want to   well that   can i can see where that might be important   and then we got that   cafeteria plan do you have that   no 
  no   you can uh   i i dont know what youre talking about there   well   you   lets see it sh   it shelters youre money that you pay for insurance   it takes it out of your   salary before taxes   oh okay yeah 
  yeah we got that   pre tax insurance   okay   yeah   yeah   but we call it the cafeteria plan i wonder why   hum   i said i wonder why   oh its probably what the first guy who did it called it   cafeteria 
  yeah   he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it   maybe so   lets see what else can   we do   changes   ill tell you what we could do   what   we could prohibit people from being hired that are   historically 
  going to cost the company money   you know do a little bit better research on who   gets hired   umhum   because   you know   i   you mean like for health insurance   well no not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company   see i look at it this way if the company folds 
  i got to go find a job   yeah   okay   now if we get somebody in a position   to   affect the way the company performs   just about anybody in the company   and theyre not doing their job or theyre not capable of doing their job then we should find   a a place to put them or b   you know boot them out 
  well thats easier done in a company than it is in   uh school teaching   well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what theyre getting paid   thank   you   what   i said thank   you   oh   well 
  were both school   teachers   im im   but its hard to get rid of a teacher if theyre not good   i know   its almost impossible   well   theres two schools of thought on that you know i   im looking at trying to get into a   university job 
  position as a professor   uhhuh   i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that   but   once you get that job with the university then youve got   ten years of   probation   uhhuh   then you have tenure   and they cant fire you 
  umhum   well   you know in a situation like   that i dont know if   thats good or bad i do know that ive had   tenured professors that were   just sorry   right   and ive also had   tenure professors that were the 
  best things on   two legs   well they did away with tenure in teaching a long time ago   you know f   in the public schools   but in addition   it made you ea more at   ease   you know you knew you   werent going to lose your job 
  unless you   really   did   something   horrendous   umhum   well   they they really cant   fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the governments taken care of that   but uh 
  what im looking at is   you know   there are a lot of teachers out there that arent   getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that arent worth having around as janitors   right   you know   and   i could see a point protecting someones position   but on the other hand i dont think it   you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance 
  should have to have a   a degree at all   well they dont   well   in some places they dont   in some places they dont   but you know you youve got specialized education now   do they   for instance   take computer science 
  you know weve got   kids   twenty years old   right now that could   beat   any computer   professor   at   microcomputer applications   i know we do 
  and these people cant even get jobs   doing anything   besides digging ditches   because theres no comprehensive   test   that they can take   that would allow them to s   to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college   you know   you know i went to college late on in life 
  and i realize that   hey you know its nothing but   four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i mean   yeah   i mean my agree is absolutely worthless   its my experience and and my knowledge that that is   beneficial   but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards   what did you get your degree in   industrial marketing 
  and whats your job   now   well actually im selling   computer software   but   the two are mutually exclusive   because   the   its experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college   huh 
  not   my   degree   which is i think kind of bizzaro   maybe   all right what else could we change   oh id like to see flexible hours   and teaching you know shared   job sharing   well lets 
  thats   more of that   weve already weve already got that   well see weve got a little bit of it but   not   much   and itd be nice if your   you had   full insurance coverage if you were   doing job sharing 
  what else id like to be able to to evaluate   your boss   and it really carry some weight   and you get to   choose your boss   umhum   well   yeah   supervisor evaluations always been a   tough one 
  especially in my line   because   you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check   huh   well so   you get to evaluate him though   why not   well   not really   you know i mean i 
  theres   no   what whats to evalu   ate him on   you know i mean   uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero   i run the whole show   and when i need something   i tell my boss and he gets it for me because he knows that i know what im doing   yeah 
  you know and uh   that   that is something that i think   needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large   market   place you know   the major corporation   because so often you know you get a guy whos got   eight or nine or ten people working for him   in separate 
  areas   so to speak   yeah   you know its its hard for me   to y you know especially since im in marketing sales   you know i make more than my boss   because hes salary and im not i make as much as i earn   you know if i dont make a sale i dont make anything   yeah well its a little tough   but uh 
  you know there are   you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make   but uh bottom line on   on that kind of thing is   you know we have   a lot of people especially in major corporations   who arent doing a damn thing   theyre just there   you know the work they do could be totally eliminated   and not that they arent working not that they arent trying or anything 
  its just that their jobs are useless   you know   take for instance um   a large construction company i used to work for   ed   swampers   swampers a guy   whos in the union hes a laborer   and hes assigned to   okay 
  in order to make   the uh curried chicken   i just   fried the chicken   uhhuh   until it was nice and brown you know make sure its nice and brown on both sides   and then you take it out of the fat   and you   you let the chicken that you fried   kind of drain 
  so that a lot of the oil comes out of it   uhhuh   and then you   you uh   pour most of the   all of the oil out of the pan and you kind of clean it out and you put back maybe two   tablespoons full of the oil   and saute some   um bell peppers and onions   in 
  in that little bit of oil   maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons   let that brown then   put all of the chicken back in there   and then you uh   mix   flour and   a cup of water   maybe   uh one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water stir it real 
  real well   uhhuh   then you uh   pour that in there you know to make the gravy   and   you let it come to a boil again and then you let it simmer and you add   uh   about a tablespoon of   what im using now is jamaican curry powder   oh 
  and thats going to its going to be really good   thats very spicy too   yeah its   i mean these bell peppers and curry   right   and then if you like it really hot you can add some hot   hot peppers and   hot sauce and all that kind of stuff   oh that sounds really good   yeah 
  huh   i guess it was is this dinner time for you   uh   well   it will be in a little while im trying to get it   get it ready early   all done in advance   thats um   i uh im   im not that great a cook 
  but   i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little   oh   you know   uh   and i cook a little bit now   what i like to do mostly is stir fries   and my wife normally says you know   oh   tom 
  why why dont you make a stir fry tonight   oh   so   we even   we just were recently married so   we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok   uhhuh   and we do a lot of um   stir fry vegetables   what kind of wok do you have is it is it a real chinese wok 
  or   its its called a stir fry pan   and it and   it fits right on your   uh si it fits right on your burner whether its gas or electric so its it has a flatter bottom   than a normal wok does   uhhuh   uhhuh   i see   and um 
  normally what happ what we do is um   just   you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil   than just regular   oi vegetable oil but i will use peanut   peanut oil or   things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um   green peppers and um   maybe put in a little bit of um   garlic and ginger 
  uh beforehand   that   gives uh uh   uh spicier flavor   and then   after the stir fry is over   just   mix in   um   a little bit of uh 
  sometimes chicken broth   and corn starch   and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh   a glaze   yeah   uhhuh   that sticks to the   the vegetables ive used   you turn them over   a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we dont put in meat 
  uhhuh   i   cause i guess were   im not   but uh she likes to   watch   all the   how much red meat   and things so   well 
  do   a lot of times vegetarian   yeah   but its a real good meal because you have squash and   broccoli   and uh   carrots and celery and green peppers and um   oh gee   mushrooms   oh thats 
  its its a pretty big and we put that over rice   that   sounds real good except the squash i just   dont like squash i never did   my mother used to cook a whole   pan full of squash   and shed have squash and corn bread   and maybe some   shed have chicken or something   oh you dont 
  oh   uhhuh   and id just be   yeah see we never   in fact i never had squash growing up my   my wife eats more vegetables ate more vegetable than i did growing up im im from pittsburgh and pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town   uhhuh   yeah   recipes in pittsburgh consisted of   red meat 
  and a potato   uhhuh   red meat   and a potato   oh that sounds good we we were from north carolina   and we had a garden and my mother would would uh grow the squash and shed grow white potatoes and   onions and   a cabbage and collards and all kinds of   oh she had all of those   types of vegetables 
  right   see never   no vegetables in my family   wow   yeah it was really funny   you wouldnt believe it we even raised chickens   you ever seen anybody kill a chicken   well that was a real farm   no   but i 
  ive ive   uh ive heard stories   no   and they   put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off   uh   and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub   and finally it dies down   get just a little patter and then it   oh this is terr 
  uh you shouldnt be talking about this right before youre while youre fixing dinner   getting ready to eat chicken too   thats right   you should be careful   thats pretty funny   but my dad used to tell stories you know about   the way they eat chickens but   i never we never   we lived in the suburbs we   we bought everything in a grocery store 
  uhhuh   there was no   but it was funny you know it so but when we got married you know a lot more vegetables a lot more   you know a lot of changes   well thats good a lot of people are eating healthier now a days   i think so too   yeah   but we just went shopping and we came back with uh   with um   sweets you know chocolate covered peanuts 
  ugh   we came back with sweets we didnt bring all the healthy food back too   yeah   im trying to learn how to cook   um   deserts without   without all of the sweets you know maybe use honey or something   uhhuh   well thats thats supposed to be um   the trend of the future 
  yeah   but   uh the cut back i uh   recently   was over a friends house   thats indian   and uh   she had brought   indian sweets   into 
  the office   and it was really funny because they were made from   yogurt   and carrots   oh   yeah that was a sweet and i was like   ugh   this is a sweet oh it is its a candy im like ugh   you know   indian candy is not very good 
  uh right   but everything was and everything you didnt notice it at first but everything was sort of hot everything had a little bit of   curry in   every   the spice yeah   it was funny even the sweets did   wow   when you first took a bite of them you didnt notice it but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it you know it had that   that after taste that   very it was a very indian flavor 
  yeah   yeah   good they didnt have   i didnt like her desserts very well   huh   they were very yogurt and carrots   and   pin pistachios   pistachio nuts and yogurt   uhhuh 
  and it wasnt very good   well i might have liked some of that i i like hot stuff   uhhuh   i really do   yeah   well have we done our ten minutes   oh is it ten minutes   something like that   i think were   i dont know do we get a signal 
  no nor normally they just come in and they say youve overextended your   oh   your conversation   well this is my first one   oh okay well thats   youll see   it will normally   it will come on and itll say youve over extended your conversation you now have   fifteen minutes to compl fifteen seconds to complete it   so 
  oh wow   but uh   ive been cut off twice   umhum   so i just thought   in fact   just also im hearing a siren outside i think my   my neighbors car must have got   bumped you know he has one of those alarms on his car   goodness 
  one of the the neighbor has an alarm on a car and its going off   uhhuh   so i was going to go out and see what they were doing   well okay   okay   hey thanks so much   yeah thank you it was nice talking with you   uhhuh and you said this was your fi well youll youll get a couple more probably   yeah   i uh 
  if   i called yesterday i   or friday maybe i talked to somebody that uh   i got them on uh during the day it was a housewife and she was home with two kids   oh   and while were talking the kids are screaming in the background   you know that they wanted something and they were arguing back and forth and she just kept talking the whole time it was pretty funny   yeah   kind of hard that way   okay 
  okay   hey thanks a lot ill talk to you later   all right thank you byebye   bye   so uh   public service uh   i guess   peace corps the one you think of the most   thats right   uh i think so i had a sister who is in the peace corps as a matter of fact 
  oh really   uh back when it was uh   a kennedy thing uh sixty   uh seven and eight   yeah   ive never had any uh   experience with anyone that ive known   personally in the peace corps my brother was uh   did a little uh   guess you would call it kind of like missionary work to liberia one time 
  uhhuh   when he was younger   well i feel like if it were   if   if everyone had an equivalent requirement   such that it were   inescapable and i think that   that   that would be important for me that   that 
  there wasnt that it was optional that if   if every   person   and i could pick a time i guess rather than worrying about whether it was one years or two years suppose it were to be   uh eighteen months   uh if   every citizen   were required   to   participate in 
  public service and could   choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any given time   and could not get out of that no matter what short of dysfunctional handicap   you know that the person were just unable to participate   i guess i would not be against that as a requirement i   im not sure the country needs it but i dont know that i would be against it and it   it seems to be it would be important that nobody could   c   c   to opt out 
  i think uh   i think i kind of agree i think that uh   you know public service is uh   has   basically if you tie it in with uh   you know a military option if you have a   if have that requirement i think that uh   this ought to be an option at least you know to   be uh some sort of a   either domestic public service or a foreign type 
  you know   peace corps type of thing   it seems that you could have a menu where   depending on the needs for jobs you could reward them differently and then let people compete for them if you   you know i could envision somebody saying   by the time you were   twenty five or pick some clock age that that would say you would have to give a certain number of years and you could   you could say well i i could go in the army i could go in the navy i could   go into civil service i could be a forest ranger   a hospital attendant or whatever and 
  and i guess some jobs that might be higher risk you might want to compensate   with some reward that was higher   which would   yeah or maybe uh   yeah you maybe might adjust the time uh   you know   oh yeah thats interesting   uh like   you can go go in the army for eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something   yeah 
  something like that   i think they do that   we have a german exchange student living with us and they uh he said they do that   something like that in germany   uhhuh   have uh   some kind of service that they have to go into   how do you feel about whether its necessary or not it if   uh it   it seems like we 
  tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but   uh how do you feel about whether its something that the country needs or what the benefits would be   i think uh   i think theres a number of reasons that it would be good to have it as a uh requirement   uh one being for the uh   benefit of the youth   or the individual them self   i think that uh   theres a lot to be gained and a certain amount of discipline and uh   you know self uh 
  self control and so forth and gain by uh certain public service plus   you know feeling of satisfaction and what have you   umhum   so youre say   so i think uh you know also theres probably theres uh   a lot to be said for uh   you know the good that would be uh become of the   public service works it might be uh and that aspect be helpful   uhhuh   yeah it seems to me like theres a lot of infrastructure problems that were accumulating in the united states that 
  uh   we could address with   with manpower everything from like well like national parks   began to be in a state of decline because we cant fund their repair and some of them were built in a period during the depression when   there were deliberate programs put in place to get people occupied and so we put   millions and millions of person hours into developing some of the parks systems and we cant afford to keep up   and we probably   in order   to return them to a state of a usefulness wed have to invest those same   person hours but we couldnt pay regular wages and 
  uh   i guess it wouldnt bother me if the wages were barely scale or subscale if it were a sacrifice that everyone made   yeah i uh i think i agree uh   like   i guess i had that in the back of my mind like the wpa and   some of those uh   uhhuh   so i   type of projects   so i wouldnt i guess i wouldnt feel like there would be a required 
  compensation as any sort of uh   the army approach room board and   forty bucks a month to uh spend at the p x   oh youre dating yourself there   that uh that was about the pay when i think i was in   yeah well that would be back in the   and he didnt have much more than that uh back in the sixties or so i mean its a little more money than that but it wasnt very much it was   you you didnt do much other than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife   but uh   uh 
  yeah exactly   but uh   you know i think the experience itself is positive   okay   i think its good   that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or   to   that theyve   if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that youve put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you   yeah 
  i agree with that   interesting   it appears   that weve come to an agreement   have we   we cant argue the point very much   okay   thanks for calling   yeah   uh 
  so long from houston   okay and from raleigh   bye   bye bye   okay so are you a   fisherman   a little bit i have not   uh have not done a lot of fishing in the last uh couple of years anyway but uh i like to fish so i ive   i take fishing magazines and read and watch fishing tv shows   yeah 
  you know im just about in the same situation here a   few years ago i got   really got into it hot and heavy and   about like you say i guess the last couple of years ive   kind of gotten out of the it ive got kids now that are   yeah   yeah   are old enough to play summer baseball and fall league basketball and that kind of stuff and uh man i just dont have the time to go like i want to   yeah well   mine are are 
  kids are both grown so thats uh thats thats   past the point now where   where i can use them as an excuse but   oh really   working and doing things around the house you know keeps you pretty busy anyway so   yeah   i tell you it really is hard to   to get time to go fishing   uh you know unless you just   yeah 
  really   really work at it almost its its its almost like a second job   yeah   what   uh   yeah   when you do fish do you fish for bass or just   yeah   yeah im   im 
  i like to go after them   big old black bass   yeah   go after the big ones yeah   where have you fished recently   oh   i got a few little old ponds up around here you know theres several around here just   i do a lot of   oh just small farm fishing and uh   i mean small 
  farm   tank   fishing and   you know uh   rock pit fishing but ive been to uh   yeah   oh the last i guess the last big lake i went to was lake fork   yeah   i have not made it to lake fork yet although ive talked about it and uh   ive got 
  uh im a cpa and ive got clients that uh or a client that lives on uh   lake tawakoni   umhum   that has told me you know anytime i wanna fish you know just come on over   yes   got a client that lives at lake at cedar creek lake and like im from east texas so ive   got uh   i think my brotherinlaw may have a place at lake palestine   so   oh are you 
  yeah   its   you know i can go fishing just about anywhere i want to go but   its a matter of finding the time you know   yeah   yeah   that is a problem   but uh   most of my fishing has been uh   just you know 
  whatever   you know whatever will bite ill fish for and my brotherinlaw likes to fish for uh crappie   yeah   and so i fish   a   bit with him you know fishing for those and then uh   you know i fish for bass fish but   basically like i said fish for what whatever i can catch   uhhuh   yeah 
  i dont know enough about fishing to   you know to say uh im going to go after a particular kind so   yeah   well i dont either really i   i like messing with the lures and   yeah   that seems to be   what the   the bass like and what you can   catch with the lures so thats 
  thats generally what i fish for   you know because i dont   particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them and   throw them back   yeah   yeah   but its uh you know i   i got into that mode where i was buying lures and and   rods and reels and   just 
  all kinds of stuff   i had one of those little   two man   uh   little two man boats that   umhum   used to go around a lot   use that a lot but   like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so   i got 
  sold that and   yeah   but its uh   yeah so   so are you a   but   yeah so im kind of limited now to   going back to my old farm pond   yeah   so are you uh 
  anticipating buying another boat or just   well   as a matter of fact uh last last fall uh   in uh   october i guess i bought   uh   i bought a boat but i bought a a ski boat   well you can fish for you can bass fish from a ski boat yeah   gonna   keep it 
  yeah   yeah you can its its not   the same as a bass boat but   yeah you can get out on the water thats the main thing   uhhuh   yeah   thats   but i   i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit uh he had uh   he had a uh bass boat 
  and hes the one i went to uh   oh like i say we went to lake   fork and cypress springs and weve been to lavon and texoma just   yeah   been around quite a bit   in the   kind of local area   but he sold his boat too so   so we just kind of   right on 
  um yeah   we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect   yeah   well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at lake texoma i was   going up there with a group   uhhuh   and uh   when i got there discovered you have to have a s special license to fish on the lake right   yeah   thats 
  well   you dont have to but it it makes it easier you got to have uh   well if you have a texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake   yeah   if you have only a texas license you have to stay   on the texas side of the lake which   uh   uh as it turns out most of the lake is in oklahoma   yeah well thats what i understood anyway i i d   discovered it was m 
  much better to have uh   uh   texoma license   yeah   and i didnt have that so i said well i wasnt going to   that plus there wasnt anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just wont worry about it   yeah   yeah   yeah   and that was probably the last time i 
  even tried to fish and or even thought about it but   yeah   ive got uh my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the   urge ever   ever bites you know im kind of available but   g go across the bridge across the water if it looks good you can just pullover and start it then   yeah right   yeah   now ive got most of mine   hung up in the garage now like i say its been a while 
  since ive   but   since ive even gotten to go   pretty days   like today like this weekend of course its too windy now but   you know it   usually dies down around sundown   ive got a little old pond just   yeah   oh just a 
  few hundred yards from my back door that i go   over there occasionally but   yeah   you know its pretty small and got   pretty small fish in it but   yeah   its nice to get out and   just start splashing on the water or something   yeah   but uh 
  do you uh read anything about fishing do you have any   any books or   magazines or anything that you take that you   no i dont take any magazines but i like to watch old berry stokes   yeah well i enjoy him too yeah   but uh   yeah hes   hes about my favorite   yeah   i watch i i take uh have just started taking the 
  that bass joined the bass   anglers club   you know and get their magazine   b a s s yeah   umhum   and uh then i take the texas fisherman   oh really   uh   yeah   and uh you know i find those to be pretty good they 
  uh the texas fisherman they uh they   do cover a   pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on   salt water you know   yeah thats   yeah i have taken some   fishing magazines in the   past and thats   thats   generally what i 
  found that   seemed like they spend a lot of time   along the coast   yeah   uhhuh   uh discussing   the type fishing that i wasnt really interested in   yeah   and then of course i guess the bass   you know the bass anglers 
  book is uh   covers the pretty well covers the country   yeah   so you dont get a lot of texas   you know   in particular coverage in that but   yeah   yeah its really more kind of   all over the south isnt it   still you get some pretty good tips 
  yeah   i believe so its   their headquarters are in alabama so   yeah   what uh what do you get when you uh   when you join the b a s   s what kind of benefits to you get   well   uh theres a number of things that you can get but basically you get the the magazine and you get that patch you know you know you get a patch and you get the bumper sticker   yeah 
  yeah   but then they theyre always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago   but they you know they send you offers and things uh   umhum   yeah   l   lure packages and things like that that you can   yeah   tackle and stuff   if you matter of fact if you uh get other people to sign up you know that to 
  to sign up for the thing you know   uhhuh   then   you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but   yeah   but theyve got uh i think they might even have a a visa card or something that they promote   you know through the club and   yeah   theyve got uh   discounts on travel 
  rental cars and things like that that   yeah   yeah i know the uh bass pro shops uh i get their   catalogs but   thats almost like a   christmas in the summertime when that   comes   but   yeah   right 
  yeah ive noticed they   theyre now   pushing a mastercard   that   you know theyre supposed to   spend so much of the money on on   conservation measures and stuff   yeah   which is a good idea i guess   yeah its a good idea i think i think we need 
  to   we need to do a lot more on   on the conservation than   you know   oh yeah   yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last   five or ten years i guess its   its really   picked up in popularity again   yeah 
  so its a lot more   you know a lot more people using the   lakes and facilities and putting more   pressure on the   fish and   taking more fish out of the lakes   yeah   so you havent fished uh joe pool lake down here yet i guess   or uh whats the other one ray roberts is that   no i havent 
  yeah now ray roberts i havent been over there but ive   i understand theres   quite a few people who have been i i think thats really going to be a good bass lake   yeah   yeah   yeah   but uh yeah i uh joe pool is so close uh you know close into dallas its a little bit of a drive from richardson   yeah   to get down there but ive got a uh couple of clients that   are down in that area 
  uhhuh   i just i just   i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just   like i said just pull over and fish a while   yeah   if i can find a p   a place to get to the water somehow   yeah i understand its kind of kind of restricted or   or   doesnt have easy access really 
  yeah so   i guess the the main thing is you know when youre   like you say when youre carrying your   tackle around in the trunk of your car and you dont have a boat laying in the trunk your car y   youre kind of restricted to bank fishing so   yeah   so you have to find a spot   which which is a   yeah which is all right you know that   thats all you can do thats all you can do but 
  yeah   yeah   its good to get out there and   and like i say throw the lure out and just   just piddle with it a little while   yeah   yeah i enjoy watching the just watching the lure work in the water sometimes just see what it does it uh   yeah   yeah some of them it takes a little while to get them to do what   what you think they ought to be done 
  yeah   yeah   one thing uh in fishing that i have not ever   have not done and im not really sure what they mean i guess is when theyre talking about   using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they   uhhuh   yeah   like they use uh   just uh its like a hook with a   little head on it 
  and then just tie a piece of uh   of rubber pork type stuff   on the hook itself   yeah   yes its just that   that pork skin uh   which you know you can get the artificial pork or you can use the real slab of pork but yeah thats thats what it is it just   umhum   but its just hung on the hook   yeah 
  uhhuh   yeah huh   i guess i couldnt imagine that it   anything like that until i started reading about it and you know and i thought you know that sounds like okay but i never would have thought of doing it so   yeah   thats thats what is amazing you know all these different rigs that people come up with you know the carolina worm rig and the   like i said the jig and pig but   id   id   i like 
  top water fishing myself you know   everybody said   umhum   okay i guess its recording   um   what kind of hobbies do you have do you sing or   knit or anything   well i um i do crossstitch and i   enjoy reading and   playing softball 
  okay   i uh i started knitting awhile ago i knitted i didnt know even know what the stitch is called i just had this uh   uh   piece of yarn and i wanted to start something so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old so i   kept doing that and now i have a little blanket but thats all ive done   oh really well i know that i learned how to knit one time and   um   so   made a few things but i havent done it in so long that i probably wouldnt remember how   um do you make sweaters and things or just blankets or 
  well if i remember i think we made some   like christmas stockings you could make the   like the granny squares or whatever and sew them together and make christmas stockings and   uhhuh   maybe some slippers or something like that   nothing as big as a blanket   i know that my   oh i see   hum   husbands grandmother does a lot of that 
  and she makes a lot of   afghans and all that kind of stuff but   uhhuh   i probably wont make anything beyond this blanket   i dont know why its just too time consuming   yeah do you have any other hobbies   um i like to sing ive been trying to   get some wedding gigs and things like that   oh   well thats good 
  um right now   my actual job is a news reporter   but uh if i could do anything i wanted to do it would be to sing professionally   but um   so are you on the tv then   yes uhhuh   i im in uh i work for channel six in waco   oh   oh okay   and so i do little news reports and things that 
  its not as exciting as it   as it sounds   but um   so you dont have too much time for hobbies   uh no not much um my day is usually pretty full   my schedule is like from nine to five thirty but i could be at work from anytime you know from nine til   yeah   nine at night or ten or whatever so its hard to make plans much less you know have a hobby   and even if i had a hobby like knitting or something and i wanted to take it to work id probably never get to it   you know so 
  yeah   what do you do   um   normally   im a housewife   oh okay   so unless the kids are asleep i dont get usually get much done either   umhum   but ive made a um   few things crossstitch things i really enjoy doing that 
  and um   umhum   i made uh   like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree skirt and that type of thing and   oh   it just takes a long time to get it done but   you know once youve done something like that it kind of makes you feel good to   to see it   but   right 
  i show i showed mine to my boyfriend and he was like you didnt make that   really   oh yeah it it looks uh halfway decent actually   first thing i did but   i guess you can make baby blankets that wouldnt take as long   yeah   how many children do you have   two   oh okay i hear them in the background there   yeah 
  all right thats a hobby in itself   not quite   a job in itself   its a fulltime job yeah   right now i was just sitting here watching tv i was getting ready to fall asleep   so um have you sang at any weddings yet   but uh   yeah i sang at one last summer   um it was my first wedding ive done   um 
  little commercials and background singing and   um i sang all through college and things like that but i really havent done anything really   professional perse   but i did one wedding last year and uh   umhum   i just now got some cards together kind of uh business cards that say   singer and   what does it say a song makes beautiful wedding or something   and ive been passing them out to different wedding shops i mean when someone comes in   umhum 
  oh thats a good place yeah   you know for a wedding   for a wedding dress and they they might ask about it   umhum   this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape you know   if any one wants to listen   yeah   and uh she wanted me to bring it in shes going to play it on saturday so   that would be great if someone came and heard it and they were like i want that voice   yeah 
  but uh   well thats good   i havent got any calls yet   but i only just put them out this week so   hopefully ill get some calls in especially now since this its spring and its the wedding season i guess   yeah   oh thats true   umhum   make your hobby into a business that would be pretty good huh   yeah that would be great then i could be getting paid for something i love to do 
  not that i dont like reporting but   id love it   yeah   did you have training in singing when you were younger then or   no ive never   ive never had uh formal training   ive just been singing   every chance i get   i try you know   in school and yeah choirs and 
  choirs and that kind of stuff   um when i was at ut i was in a group called ensemble one ow nine just twelve singers and we   did uh little conventions and   um   uh   like dinner parties and   things like   that   huh   well thats nice 
  sing pop music   so   thats what got me really really interested in it   umhum   so im trying to be sen   sensible too at the same time   yeah not just   give up your job and jump   right into it   yeah exactly my parents would have a fit probably 
  but uh   i think i either have a ca or yeah i do have a call hold on one second   uhhuh   hello   yes   yes okay thats my mother on the other line i need to go   oh   but um i think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes are we suppose to hear a beep or anything   i dont know ive only done this one other time and   i thought that the man told me five minutes

  thanks bye   so whats your opinion   about the uh the   increasing roles of women in society today   well i think the biggest change   in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work   now i think   overall theres   been a change i dont think um   thats uh 
  been surpassed by anything else   than uh that because most women seem to be   taking into careers and working now and   changing the way the family situation is because theyre now working and we have to have   people to babysit and such   uhhuh   see uh   the way the way i look at it is that   i dont think that the   that theres more women 
  in   you know working today   i think   that   the role of women in society is changing in a way that   instead of   working   in the house   theyre working   you know for paying jobs so it seems that women are becoming more prominent in society 
  you know it seems that theyre doing more work i think the work is the same its just that theyre getting   different jobs different   you know theyre theyre   how do you say theyre uh   employed outside the home now   yeah theyre   theyre uh   up into more open space where   more people can see what work theyre doing   you know you dont get credit for working in the house but you do get credit for being the president of a corporation 
  more visible things   and things that use different kinds of   mental skills   exactly visible   right   maybe thats a a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending on   uh   you know how big the house is and whether you had you know a lot of children   may not take as much   mental skills and such as what working outside the home does 
  exactly   uh   i think a lot of the modern conveniences today   you know have   eliminated   matter of fact you know   i think women   even back maybe two hundred years ago   when we were first starting the country   may have been looked at a little differently because it was really important to have 
  the woman there   and she   probably   you know   gave half   of   the uh work output   in like a farm   you know her skills were as needed as the mans   to you know to like establish a farm from the beginning 
  uhhuh   and then it got to be that   you know with the industrial age i think   the women   uh were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big operation as a farm and their   the work was more confined to the   household chores   which   didnt really   uh have as much to do with the whole livelihood of the family 
  if you were in a farm situation   its kind of   kind of   kind of gone all the way around that way in the beginning   you know their work input   for a farm   and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such was as important as the mans   you know needed both   exactly just as important   and then she got to be kind of in the house when 
  that wasnt needed as much   and now shes kind of like back out of the house   but not working for the family business working   you know somewhere else   yeah i think thats the thats also has a lot to do with uh todays society you know   in in the past the uh the woman   was suppose to be at home cooking for the men who were working   nowadays its like   everything is so   is is so integrated 
  a man can be a mother nowadays you know its like just like uh what was that movie uh mister mom seven years ago   yeah   and you know its its true you dont you know a woman and a man are are pretty much equal nowadays   in   in work   its like   you dont have to be a woman to be a babysitter you can be a guy you dont have to be a man to be uh you know the president of a corporation its   its not its not what you are its   what your abilities are   thats the thats the important thing so it doesnt 
  you know its its integration of it doesnt matter if your a man or a woman   that   makes it all you know   everything makes everybody   look equal for a job so it doesnt matter   nowadays that you know theres theres really no difference is is you know the   the law   the law says theres no difference so   more women are   are taking that opportunity 
  to be in those spots   well some are kind of forced to but   i did see something in the paper today i didnt read it through thoroughly but there was uh article about   a   a project a study that elizabeth dole had started when she was still at the department of labor   something called glass ceiling it was trying to look at   how uh much opportunity there is for women executives to move up theyre still saying that there are too many   women in higher   uh echelons as management   you know ceos and that kind of thing 
  too many   n no theres not many   theyre saying that theres kind of like a glass ceiling that   uh   you just dont find too many women in those   positions   i think it will just kind of take time   um   oh okay okay   you know for women to be more acce you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have 
  progressed   education and experiencewise i mean   starting with women working   a lot in the work force in the last twenty years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills   to be a ceo   yeah   and im a little frustrated too because a lot of women   who have their own businesses   still dont seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of consider a more woman kind of business i call it like   the three cs 
  like theyre into cookies   like mrs fields   right   and   theyre into cosmetics   like mary kay   and theyre into uh clothing   uhhuh   you know   but they havent really branched out into some other things like you dont find too many women 
  uh really involved with technology   one thing thats kind of due to the the market you know   uh   uh a womans   cookie store is much preferred to a mans you know a womans clothing store is much preferred to a a mans   clothing store for women you know   like you   uh   a guy wouldnt want   to buy a car designed by a women 
  why   you know its just like that   why   its it no its just these these things you know these these uh   values that that youre brought up with   how about a computer designed by a woman   oh see thats different   uh a computer is unisex   oh oh okay   unless you design it in some sort of way which can really satisfy you and not a man around 
  i dont know   but historically   historically you think of cars being done by ford and such so you dont want to think about a car now designed by a woman huh   exactly you know its like   just one of those those things uh that youre brought up with   well   theres possibility that theres some woman on those design teams   well even im sure there is but you know you dont want   you dont want a car thats designed a man doesnt want a car thats purely designed by a woman   same reason that 
  you may not want a dress or you may not want you know you you   hey theres some men designers out there that do very well   bob macky and such   of course but theyre homosexual   yeah those those men are homosexual like uh whats that   pierre cardin and and uh   halston   course he died of aids so there thats proof   oh oh oh   well 
  i have to go eat dinner now   uh thank you very much for talking bye   okay   all right bye   well   the thing is is that uh since im in school i dont like basically have a monthly budget because im living off my dad   but   the thing is is that um   i have to keep it   under control 
  because   for example you know its like   the the beginning of the semester when you g have to pay for everything   yeah   everythings pretty rough   but   he controls that part   but then   whenever   you know its like once the semester start im the one who has to control how much spending there is 
  and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just   food   and uh   so   yeah   what about tuition and rent   who takes care of that   well the thing is is that i live in a dorm   uh   so uh 
  what happens is you pay six hundred dollars   at the beginning   or even before school starts   and the the tuition is also the same thing   yeah   so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries   and thats about it   but the thing uh   also is that you know like if you   want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something 
  then i have to moderate that because its like i cant go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars   uh you know three times a week   no cant do that very often   so i mean its   for for us you know its like i i can spend   i can spend that money   but its not   its not what i want to spend it on   you know   are 
  a   are you working anywhere   while youre going to school   no   because um   they dont allow me to work   since uh im a foreign student   okay   oh   okay 
  and so they   the government doesnt allow me to work   yeah   so all the money comes from home   uhhuh   so you got to make uh   so how do you keep track of where you are in   in your monthly spending   well the thing is is that um   i ba i basically know how much i have right 
  right   and so the thing is is that   i i can tell like   uh i get all my money out of the teller   yeah   and besides see o one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international   where do you call to   argentina   yeah   argentina 
  wow   and so   the bas   one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills   yeah   talk too long   well thats   they w they want me to call down there   every so often i me i told my dad li dad listen if you want   to save money i wont call so often 
  you know he goes   we want to keep in touch so it doesnt matter about the money   because we need to hear from you   yeah   yeah   yeah   so you call him collect   no   because its more expensive that way   uh any any 
  uh   basically the united states is the cheapest country to call   out of   i would suspect so   yeah   and uh because its considered luxury in other countries   oh okay   so you just call him direct and then   right since its his money anyway   you know 
  yeah   so that   and he gets the and you get the bill and send it to him   no   uh i got money to pay that too   okay   so its basically you know its like   its not too much money and its not too little money so   i wont have to you know   rush a letter to him or something 
  because uh   he really wants me to concentrate on my studies   yeah   yeah   what are you s what are you studying   im doing masters in computer science and computer engineering   and what do you think youll do with that   with those degrees   umhum   well i can i can work up uh here up to a year 
  and i mean   and hopefully get a job   after that   you want to get into some kind of manufacturing or   or   whats the specialty that youre looking for   uh   computer communications and data transmissions   oh okay so you want to find a uh   data transmissions youre looking for uh 
  um   long distance   right   type stuff   yeah you know anywhere from uh   local area networks metropolitan area networks   you know   all that and and so well you have a family right   yeah   yeah 
  yeah i have uh   wife and two   children   and uh   a   and does does your wife work   no she doesnt work   she does uh   well its kind of hard to say   now days 
  uh   other than taking care of the house   she does   a lot of sewing herself   and she gets paid for that so she brings some money in   oh okay   yeah   shes trying to start h her own business where she does   that full time   uh alterations and sewing and 
  stuff for the public and uh   do that on a on a full time basis   here in town   okay   yeah   and so and you have a monthly budget   well s   sort of were probably like most   am american families i guess that   we sort of have a budget in that we know how much weve got 
  at the end of the month and we know what bills have to be paid   right   and uh we pay   as many of those bills that can be paid with   with the monthly budget   so   so you dont have any problem in uh   overcharging on your credit card and stuff like that   oh sure   were like everybody else you know you weve got a 
  uh   several credit cards that   sometimes   uh   instead of paying them all off   at every month   maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it   next month especially around christmas time   you know thats when   everybody goes crazy on charging stuff 
  yeah   yeah   well then uh see uh thats   thats one of the points which i dont   see like i i dont give a lot of gifts during christmas and i   you know i dont wa i dont like to give any at all   because the thing is is that   you know its like if i want something ill ill ask somebody you know   like   yeah 
  yeah   like m uh for ch for christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want   and i said i want a backpack   yeah   you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for christmas give me a backpack   yeah   but something that you can use   right because i i needed a backpack so   he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock   so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that 
  that   yeah   thats very   uh   utilitarian   you know   right   but   you make those things there are no no frivolous gifts   right 
  but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down argentina it was to me was ridiculous   because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you dont care about you know its like   yeah   thats true   why bother   yeah   yeah   and so but the thing is is that um   well especially being a college student you   your 
  i dont know that   you need to be involved in   a lot of   frivolous gift giving   you know that   effects the budget   especially around uh   christmas time its the end of the semester youve got finals and youve got lots of bills i would suspect   yeah   yeah 
  yeah   what about   when you have breaks like uh   christmas or between sessions   well   for example we had spring break now and i went skiing   and i spent around like maybe   two hundred dollars   or   yeah 
  i expect so   so uh   but you know its like   uh   youve got to budget that though youve got to save up   in able to do that right   yeah   yeah   because its like you know   say you know its like were saying lets go eat out 
  before spring break i go lets not go eat out before spring break lets see how much money we have afterwards   i mean   hm   hm yeah   yeah   right   right   and if i felt like i spent way too much   then uh i wont go out you know   right 
  and so   like my roommate went home i went skiing   in uh over the carolina mountains which arent anything   hm   but um   but it was you know   it was i guess it was worth it   you know it was a nice place   sure it is any time you can get away and and get away from   from the daily grind 
  yeah   yeah   yeah especially if you live on campus and you dont have a car   you just go crazy   yeah i know the feeling   so   oh well lets see   how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half   okay   yeah 
  is that okay   all right   all right well nice talking to you   all right byebye   oh   nice talking to you have a good time   bye   i guess   im going to school while im uh working at ti so   theres not a whole lot of time that ive got 
  uh for hobbies   seems like lately   but one of one the things that i do when ive got some spare time is and i do some woodworking   and that   oh i guess ranges   anywhere from uh   carpentry work   to uh   uh   some types of furniture 
  and uh   oh i dont know what you would call them knickknacks i guess stuff you hang on the wall and to put a mirror on and   i made some uh   candle sconces that you hang   on the   yeah i have quite a few of those that my uncle made   theres something about working with wood that   that i enjoy that   i dont know if its the saw dust or the mess you make or   the smell of the wood but 
  you know   i think its more like the mess you make isnt it and you dont have to worry about   cleaning it up   yeah because its its out there you know i dont have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust and   the wife gets kind of aggravated at that but then i get the opportunity   to vacuum   so   i guess i get s some of both   uh what are some of your   things you like to do 
  well when i have time i do like to sew um i had been doing a lot of crocheting i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them   yeah   my mother was real heavy into crafts and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing and then she would go to these uh   arts and crafts shows and sell her   needlework   oh yeah   so a lot of times id help her with that i havent had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately weve been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going   yeah its a good time   for gardening   oh 
  yeah its been beautiful this last week but   i could do with a little less wind but   i think the the temperatures been pretty good so far for working outside   yeah   do you   find you do most of your   your uh   crocheting or your knit work   around christmas time   i usually start in the fall 
  yeah   and   my husband says i do it you know make afghans so i can keep my lap warm   well   thats kind of what my wife says she   enjoys doing it during the cold weather because shes always got something to cover her l   her legs and feet with while shes working on it   yeah   i know seems like   she i think she made three this year one for 
  uh my fatherinlaw and and then a couple of brothers and sisters so   uh sh   those things they take some time to make   yeah i   found one thats real easy it its um   um   um shoot i cant even remember the name of it now   but you make it in strips and its real easy to do and its just that it doesnt keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that but its   oh thats kind of like quilting   yeah 
  yeah   i think the   mile a minute thats the name of it   mile a minute   mile a minute   well im not sure what she does i i   first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts   and goes all the way across   you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan   i 
  guess thats your standard   knitting isnt it   yeah   yeah usually single crochet would is is always starts it off   yeah   if we have a problem with our connection and get   disconnected some time or other dont worry about it we have a a very   small   phone company down here   i know 
  oh   okay   and   my husband says thats called rinkydink   call instead of call waiting or call anything else   no   no we cant have that down here   we get disconnected all the time   well i guess that   thats one way to end a conversation 
  yeah   well it   gets a little aggravating ive got kids all over the united states and and you know sometimes they get disconnected when im talking to them   yeah   what uh have you started your garden yet   yes we planted um potatoes and onions and bell peppers   um boy   uh   what else did i get in there and jalapeno peppers   oh yeah always got to have those 
  yeah   i think i had four uh   jalapeno plants last year i think one of them died but i   i got   s   you know i put them i chop them up and put them in jars and   usually give them away because i do theres no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them but   always got to keep those planted   yeah   oh my husband doesnt like them either but i can always give them away 
  well thats kind of the way i am   um   besides theyre fun to grow   i planted uh zucchini last year   uh i planted four   hills of them i think i had   three or four s seeds in each one of them   and   those things just flat took over   um 
  it wasnt til late   i guess in the summer   maybe it was because it was too dry they finally started making zucchini   and im not sure when a good time to plant those is   if   if they should be planted early or later   it seems like all i got was   supposedly after the soil warms up   i would think so   um seems like these all they all went to uh 
  to leaf   and it wasnt until   late in the summer they started making fruit so i dont know if im   mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon   you know but i dont   umhum   i hadnt looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is   i i doubt if   zucchini is in there   it may not be it may not be 
  probably the same time the the other squash is though   you think they are later in the year   yeah   uh   about the same time that you plant okra because its supposed to be warm   well thats true mostly okra thats grown around here is is later okra   yeah   we decided this year   im sorry go ahead   well thats about uh 
  go ahead   well i was just going to say we   its a little over   six or seven minutes so   whenever you feel comfortable about   concluding well im um thatd be fine   oh just anytime   well all right i guess   well call this one quits and thanks for participating   all right well ive enjoyed talking to you 
  all right have a good time   okay   bye   bye   uh robert what   do you uh   think   what substances do you think   are the most   uh 
  likely causes   of air pollution   um   gee i dont i mean i   i guess its the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust   you know they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that   right   so i believe them but im not a chemist   do you um   do you think that those are bigger contributors than 
  things like ai acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from   industrial um areas   factories and so on   i dont really know   um i grew up in los angeles and have   felt like i was victimized by air pollution   i was going to say and and you so you understand smog   i understand it very well and in fact i was a private pilot there   umhum   and i can remember 
  very   etched   etched clearly in my mind   uh   flying and coming up above the smog layer at about three thousand feet and looking back down and and really being unbelieving at   what looked like a uh   wow   it just looked liked peanut butter   my word   thick and brown and so on 
  and that was a few years ago   this was quite a few years ago this was in the nineteen sixties   i   i wonder if its any better now   people say that it is somewhat better   because they uh   california has such strict rules   um about emissions and so on um   right   i 
  i dont know if you h uh heard about the uh recent   legislation in   um   colorado   um   against a power company   uh   thats actually on indian land i believe   but um   it has 
  uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that its causing   terrible smog over the grand canyon   hm   and um   i particularly in the winter months   so they it was   uh   a landmark case because its unusual   to um i cant think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didnt comply and so on   so did it burn coal 
  i dont know that   the information is one of those wire services kind of new   pieces of news you know and so its hard   i never did see the   full story so i dont know   but they said that   it that it really caused so much smog   over uh the grand canyon in the winter months that they couldnt do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter   trips and that sort of thing   yeah 
  hm   which would be horrible because the theres nothing   i mean thats such a spectacle itd be a shame to ruin it   yeah   yeah   uh   what do you think individuals   could   do or society could do to alleviate this problem   uh 
  i dont uh   i dont know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals   um maybe   just take good care of our cars and make sure we keep our pollution devices clean and all that sort of thing   right   um   apart from that   i   i dont know what we can do as individuals   what do you think we can do 
  umhum   you think its more we more in society well   i guess i kind of agree there i   um   on an individual basis there isnt a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we   are concerned about it then we certainly can uh   force   uh   government   uh that we elect 
  to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit im not always   real politically active but i do think that   yeah   um   congress has   backed down   much too much on some of the air pollution   standards   and its brought   their 
  the they   uh really listen to the   the uh lobbyist   yeah   and uh the   m car manufacturing companies have uh   you know have really pushed saying all those re   those restrictions too hard we cant   we cant quite make that   go and they dont and then we still live with air pollution 
  yeah   um so i suspect that thats one thing that   that as individuals we can do   make our voices known perhaps to our legislators   but um   as a society   i think   we can do more and thats probably how we ought to do it   uh individ being individually responsible   a as 
  uh   in order to be group responsible   yeah   i guess im   im to the point where im cynical enough   that i really dont believe anything will happen unless   unless theres something   economically justifiable about it   right   and in the case of air pollution it simply might turn out 
  at some point down the road   to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems and everything else   umhum   that well spend the money thats necessary to   uh to get rid of the source of it   i suspect that the pub that theres going to have to be a lot of pressure uh   come to bear on the   companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen   is for um   governments to realize that they have to pay if companies dont 
  yeah   and uh i dont know how long that   thatll take   people also have to realize they cant have their cake and eat it so if you dont want to burn coal for power how about nucle nuclear energy well we dont want that either   sure   exactly   yeah right   how about investing in the sun well nobody wants to pay twenty five cents a kilowatt hour   i dont think   uh i probably wouldnt mind if it really came down it wou 
  right   yeah   well its just the same thing with the car   um   uh the gasoline   now is a wonderful time to smack a   fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we dont um   run into this kind of problems weve recently had   yeah   oh yeah yeah yes 
  yes   and yet the governments not going to do that because   people are too dependent and they dont wanna   they dont want to pay for it   so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war   um   you know f   wha however   yes   i it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor 
  oh certainly yeah   um   and i think thats probably going to happen with   with   such things as air pollution when we   when we se get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh   yeah   then maybe   you know well have a little bit of help   um 
  uh do you have any air pollution in your area   theres not really a lot here in raleigh uh once in a while well get some   uh i think it kind of washes down from   uh the   from your area linda   oh no   thats what they thats what they   your talking about from from the uh   the middle middle states that   that have more 
  factories and so on   yeah   yeah thats what they say but its   its not   its not very usual and certainly we dont have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities   yeah   we really dont have that either although i think i can tell a difference   in   i lived in   this area for about twenty five years 
  and i think i can tell a difference   in the comfort level   um   particularly in the summer   uh   you know when it gets hot   and you have the   that kind of a   pressure from the pockets of air   um 
  usually they say caused by exhaust   umhum umhum   yeah   it seems to me that im more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on   so i suspect that its its an ever growing problem   yeah   well i suspect that weve probably   covered everything that we need to here   it was nice talking to you   right i think 
  weve given them about seven minutes according to my watch and i enjoyed the conversation   so did i   byebye   bye   all right have you lived in this area long   no ive only been here a couple of years   uh but uh   i i ive noticed that uh this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past   okay   yeah its it its 
  its a lot warmer   a lot drier too   because usually about this time of year theres   you know you see a little bit more rain   i mean by   uh by mid february i mean we start getting a lot of rain   yeah   yeah well i remember last year or or the year before   uh we had ice and snow we had a had a   terrible ice storm uh around this time of the year 
  but it   umhum   and uh this year its been so hot   and   uh sunny it   it its really   uh   quite uh   quite amazing   yeah unseasonable 
  i used to my wife and i we used to live in san antonio   couple years ago and   it was   it was i remember the first day of spring   it was so much ice   that came down   hm   later on that a   that afternoon evening   it was just 
  it was horrible   yes i was just talking to my son today hes up in boston and   it was twenty nine there and   it was you know in the seventies out here and   it was really uh   he really wished he could be here rather than there   yeah   yeah   well   um 
  i dont know i i guess im just sort of acclimated to colder weather   um   i l i like it warmer i mean i like it   oh really   you know i like it   warm but it doesnt really matter i mean id i would much rather see it cooler at this time of year anyway   because it would   mean a little bit more   rain possibly   uhhuh 
  but   um   uhhuh   i havent you know i d i don i think its really been delightful i   i come uh ive spent most of my time in in warm weather areas and uh   uh   the ice and snow just doesnt   uh   hold any allure for me at all   well i spent three years in germany so im 
  not too thrilled with the whole   thing anyway   uhhuh   i mean i got used to it it was really strange i mean when i   when   when   when we came to san antonio it was just like   uh   uh you know it just   just swelter 
  and then we got used to it and then we went up to dallas and it was just   its   its not   its not that its just   hot or dry its just   its   not very comfortable   it just   he do you you think think san antonios more comfortable than dallas   yeah a little bit 
  umhum   yeah   it   you must well uh t   it must be quite a bit hotter down there isnt it   yeah   my wife and i   the last day we were in florida we   my   visiting my um 
  my my parents and   my brother and sister   we were   we were down there and   the last day right before we left   we had to i had to ride with my sister   and the air conditioning went out on the car and   you know you g you you ust get used to air conditioning all the time   oh wow   oh yes 
  and this   it was just   the humidity was like   eighty plus   eighty percent plus and it was just   killing us   oh yeah its terrible   yeah orlando is the only place ive ever been where ive seen the car sweat   i mean yeah thats really bad   yeah 
  yeah   well   i mean ive   i   i i guess ive   ive been to some places you know where the weather was just so mild you know places like monterey california or   uhhuh   uhhuh   you know its just you know so mild and then b been to such extremes like san angelo texas where you just where you walk outside   and you sweat you know youre sweating 
  yeah   you look down at your arm   but you see the water leaving your arm   its so hot   and you feel it pulling away   hm wow   hm   i know i i i tend to   bizarre   i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when its very temperate uh uh it doesnt doe some people say uh they they like to watch the changing of the seasons but 
  yeah   uh   i id rather   you know like southern california you know have it   kind of sunny and temperate all the time   yeah   so   its kind of a luxury   i tend to agree but   i dont know i i think 
  in   in some in some respects it   oh it seems more tolerable   well i guess this the weather isnt as as lively a topic as uh   as some of the others we might have gotten   no the other topics   i got one topic they said   talk about the middle east sit   well   i guess were supposed to say goodbye or something like about what my daughter is here prodding me say goodbye 
  we messed up the conversation   anyway   well   i mean ive had some pretty bad i guess some pretty   controversial topics so its   just like   well that was my fault but   but then the weathers like   man i mean its   it 
  gets pretty mundane i mean you can only   talk   about   about the situation you know   just so long   inspiring   okay well nice talking to you tony   okay   byebye   do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace 
  um   i have mixed feelings about it   um i dont particularly care for people who   take drugs and uh   its a possibility of having accidents in the workplace but   um i also feel like its an invasion of privacy   yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well   uh not just the invasion of privacy but   the the chance of uh false positive be   being 
  reported   right   right   uh i have been drug tested   in the past and its not really a pleasant experience at work   umhum   umhum   and   uh   it 
  gives you the uh   im   the uh impression that the company really doesnt trust the people that work for them   right   and youre pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results   right   yeah   yeah i have a lot of problems with it   um i um i have been tested also several times   and uh in 
  fact it has always come up negative i mean but thats no problem   with it   yeah   coming up negative   but i do take prescription   drugs   and im always been afraid that those were going to come up and show something on any of the tests   yeah   well   they make uh 
  allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take   the test   yeah   but theres always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later   right   or if the prescription   say ran out or if youre using something thats uh older than   older than the date uh on the package or whatever   umhum   right 
  right   yeah but i agree with you though they uh theyre trying to uh   you know   theyre theyre saying that you are guilty until proven innocent and uh and i dont really appreciate that at all   yeah   yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh   what it was they detected   uh were required to go attend a uh a counseling session   umhum   and 
  uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record   right   its just not not a real good   uh thing to have   on your uh   employment uh   records   no no because this can follow you um   at other places too   i was reading uh this morning in the newspaper where it was talking about um 
  they have companies or or organizations out now who   will go and do background searches on uh employees before they ever hire them   sure   and if you get   one of those false negative reportings and and youre fired from your job   thats going to carryover into other jobs   um no matter um   you know if its truth or not   so yeah it can stick with you for a long time   yeah 
  uh   according to uh   to the way that that our test is set up   apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period   right   and uh   they they do it on a random basis im not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random   umhum   umhum   so im not sure exactly what they base that on 
  well   uh   cause you work for ti   also right yeah because uh i think what they say what they would uh   take your name out of the hopper   yeah   umhum   sure   so that   whatever is left in the hopper 
  you know its its um   uh thats when youd be tested   and then when you were tested then itd be taken out of there   so thats thats how they said they would uh do it   over a five year period   okay   well im not sure exactly if thats true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time   umhum   and many have not been tested yet   um 
  well its only been what a year   two years   uh   couple of years yeah   umhum   umhum   yeah it hadnt been i know i was called up right away   it didnt no i was called up lets see yeah we started testing in january and i was called up right away   in january   okay 
  it took them awhile to find me   oh no   well th they did all the all the top level managers   uhhuh   uh at first   uhhuh   and uh everybody else uh   gets to take their turn   right   right 
  so they called me in uh just a few months ago   umhum   yeah but yeah youre right that wasnt a very pleasant experience   right   especially i felt like there was a   camera   watching   oh no   i never thought about that i   i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though 
  uhhuh   asked her if she enjoyed her job   whatd she say   she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people   yeah on a continuing basis too   so   i try i try to introduce some levity there   you know that was uh that was a really interesting because it was a great big room   the bathroom   it was 
  it was a great big room   and uh   and i remember th the vents you know just right over the top of the   toilet   uhhuh   yeah   a and i just   just knew i was being   photographed you know i just   im glad i dont have to go through that experience again 
  yeah   yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have   yeah   and in fact i know some people that uh   probably will quit   before being tested   even though theres nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know   from the test results   just a matter of principle   right 
  yeah   yeah   well um   i guess growing up in the sixties and   uh   i dont know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have   some friends who are occasional   uh marijuana smokers   and   oh yeah 
  you know its just a hangover   i guess from uh from that particular generation   and uh but yeah theyre theyre just adamant that theyre not   going to be   you know tested   and theyre going to fight it and   um you know try and   um see what they can do   that its an invasion of privacy   but 
  i dont particularly care to uh   you know to   uh   to   get into drugs or anything else so   its not a problem for me but i uh i   can kind of understand from the other point of   view   yeah   well i know some people that i suspect are casual 
  users of uh marijuana as well   and i expect that they probably uh   mended their ways uh   in uh   umhum   in response to this uh drug testing   that   they no longer uh   even use anything like that on a casual basis   right 
  yeah   yeah   because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time   umhum   and even the first time uh for these people are uh   oh   well on their way in   on on the technical ladder   or management   and 
  theyre jeopardizing their positions   yeah   oh yeah   yeah   i i could really see that   uh   so yeah theyll just have to find   other means of uh   relaxing and   yeah 
  yeah   but   the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other   those   socalled   uh   illegal drugs you know what about alcohol   well   some companies have   gone that far uh ti has not 
  umhum   umhum   but   others have and theyre   setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think   than   uh   i think so   yeah   yeah 
  but you know   alcohol   destroys you know so many families so   now   than we are   so thats thats what i thought was interesting that uh there are   still drugs out there   and then there are those   socially   acceptable drugs 
  yeah   right   i dont mind so much the fact that they test people but uh   not questioning the validity of the results   is is a problem because uh   you know   umhum   uh   i i i fully expect that that   any test results that comeback for me would be negative 
  that in in the event that one would be positive   theres no recourse other than   get yourself a lawyer   or   go to this counseling session and admit guilt   uh they wont accept anything else   umhum   oh yeah yeah yeah because youd be strongly into denial   its just like well   we know you take it weve got the positive test results and youre going 
  i dont i dont   right   yeah   well if if you turn down the counseling the they will fire you   right   thats uh condition of employment   right   right   yeah i think theres some flaws in it   i 
  i think their main objective is is good   you know to make sure they have a drug free   workplace   but   i do think that there are a lot of flaws in there   sure   and i understand that the   government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that ti is using   is that right   um 
  yeah because theyre not as reliable   as the government wants them to be   i thought thats the only one that the government   does use so   oh   well i heard just the opposite   im not sure   so i dont know   it could just be rumors   that spread around you know when they 
  okay   yeah there arent just too many places uh   that do testing like that where the government uh   uh   gives   well   gives them full reign   uh   trust the results   because they have to 
  prove on a continual basis that uh   that they are meeting um their standards for   false positives and whatnot   umhum   yeah   right   umhum   they claim   uh   zero false positives ever 
  and i find that very hard to believe   oh   yeah   that that to me yeah   itd be very hard to believe too   okay   well   uh   hum   is our five minutes up
