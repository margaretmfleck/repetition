  okay   hi   hi   um   yeah id like to talk about   how you dress   for work and and um   what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear   well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice   so i usually wear skirts and sweaters 
  in the winter time   slacks i guess   and in the summer just dresses   umhum   we cant even well were not even really supposed to wear jeans very often   so   it really doesnt vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of   you know always the same temperature   and is   right right is there is there um 
  an is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask   so   not formally   right   but its kind of understood that   were supposed to dress a little bit nice   a lot of times we have to go over to uh   like jerry junkins office and bill ellsworths office to deliver stuff   right   and we prepare a lot of foils for marvin and bill so
